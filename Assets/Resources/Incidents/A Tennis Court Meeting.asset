  _nodeText:
  - 'This morning, the representatives from the third esate went to meet in their
    usual chambers, but were blocked by a combination of armed gaurds and construction
    workers, who claimed their chambers were being shut down for rennovations.


    When the representatives attempted to enter anyway to hold a meeting, the armed
    guards forced them away at gunpoint.'
  - Without a place to meet, the increasingly angry representatives found an empty
    tennis court. There, they met and discussed the latest issues ahead of them, especially
    the Crown's latest attempts to thwart their ability to organize.
  - They were not alone in this meeting, joined by several sympathetic members of
    the clergy, as well as a group of nobles who aimed to reach across the political
    aisle, and break the deadlock that has been plaguing the Estates General.
  - 'In a sudden moment of unity, all the members of the third estate vowed that they
    wouldn''t disband until they''ve established a written constitution for France. '
  - 'Sympathetic to the cause of the poor, a large group of priests from the countryside
    parishes broke away from the official stance of the first estate to pledge their
    allegiance to the National Assembly. '
  - Unforunately, this meeting in the tennis courts made little progress. Bogged down
    by infighting between the capitalists of the bourgeoisie, and the more high-minded
    revolutionaries within the third estate, the National Assembly failed to articulate
    what they really wanted.
  - "(The Revolution has lost a decent amount of power) \n(The Bourgeoisie has lost
    a decent amount of power)\r\n(The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Crown some)"
  - "(The Revolution has gained a decent amount of power)\n(The Church has gained
    a decent amount of power)\r\n(The Church has moved closer to the Revolution some)"
  - "(The Revolution has gained a decent amount of power)\n(The Bourgeoisie has gained
    a decent amount of power)\r\n(The Bourgeoisie has moved closer to the Revolution
    some)"
  - However, rather than relieve the growing tension, this only seems to have heightened
    it. His Majesty the King has yet to make a statement on the National Assembly,
    and this indirect effort to curtail them seems to have backfired quite significantly.
  - In a sudden moment of unity, all the members of the third estate vowed that they
    wouldn't disband until they've established a written constitution for France.
    Unexpectedly, they were greeted with support from a large group of priests who
    have broken from the official stance of the first estate to pledge their allegiance
    to the National Assembly.
  - '(The Revolution has gained quite a bit of power)

    (The Bourgeoisie has gained some power)

    (The Bourgeoisie has moved closer to the Revolution some)

    (The Church has moved clsoer to the Revolution some)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - 'His Majesty, the King''s indirect method of diverting the National Assembly seems
    to have weakened them through frustration and infighting. Yet, rather than relieve
    the growing tension, this only seems to have heightened it. '
  - The exact wording of this tennis court oath borrowed heavily from the Declaration
    of Independence issued by the American colonists to the King of England. It's
    not surprising, as many of the most ardent consitutionalists were the same officers
    sent by the His Majesty to help the Americans throw off the shackles of an unjust
    monarch.
  - Now, they have brought that fight home.
  - This is the first time the third estate has openly opposed His Majesty, the King,
    and they do it with the support of those who speak for God.
  - What's a higher priority? Equal taxation, or equal say in governance?
  - This is the first time the third estate has openly opposed His Majesty, the King.
  - While there is still infighting amongst the capitalists of the bourgeoisie, and
    the more high-minded revolutionaries within the third estate, this sudden show
    of support has given them a much stronger negotiating position.
