  _nodeText:
  - "Pierre claps his hands together in delight, \u201CMadame, it appears that you
    have done me a great service! With all of this gossip together, I can finally
    launch my most comprehensive social piece yet!\u201D"
  - "\u201CNow, I assume, you wish to know more about your beloved Armand, <i>non</i>?\u201D"
  - "\"It may shock you to learn that your Armand managed to keep some rather\u2026
    opinionated company.\" Pierre says with the careful circumspection of someone
    severely downplaying the seriousness of a situation."
  - "Pierre sighs and mops the sweat from his brow with a severely stained handkerchief.
    \u201CTo be honest madame, I am in a bit of a tough situation.\u201D"
  - '"While the details of their beliefs have been remarkably difficult to track down,
    I know two things about their views. The first is that they showed an open disdain
    for the country''s current laws and priveleges, which made them unwelcome with
    the aristocracy supporting the Crown. However, they also harbored a strong devotion
    to the Queen, which alienated them to the nationalists in the Revolution."'
  - "\u201CNow, before you leave madame, I hope that you do not forget about me and
    my humble paper. I still find your social insights valuable, and I\u2019m stilling
    willing to pay for anything you can bring to me.\u201D "
  - "\"There\u2019s a studio in the seventh <i>arrondissement</i> where he and some
    like minded individuals preferred to discuss the 'proper' course for the country.
    Painters in the front, planning in the back.\" Pierre starts scribbling on a piece
    of paper."
  - "He hands you the paper, it\u2019s an address. \"The <i>Guet Royal</i> raided
    the studio a month ago and arrested everyone there. While supporting the Queen
    is certainly not a crime, something about this group's beliefs was making someone
    in power very uncomfortable. The studio has been abandoned ever since. Go there,
    and you might find something that leads you to your Armand.\u201D"
  - "\u201CJournals like my own have always existed in one\u2026 unofficial capacity
    or another, but with the end of royal censorship, new papers are opening every
    day! The competition for readership, and for new information, has become ridiculous!\u201D
    Pierre throws up his hands in exasperation."
  - "\u201CI can\u2019t just print gossip that\u2019s been sold to everyone else.
    My readers expect something unique in these pages, not the same unoriginal tripe
    bandied about in those\u2026 lesser papers.\u201D\n\nYou find yourself slightly
    taken aback by the sincerity in Pierre\u2019s voice. "
  - "\u201CI needed you because most of my sources have taken their business to other\u2026
    less esteemed publications.\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Merci beaucoups</i>, madame\u2026\u201D he sighs, pausing to inhale
    a heavy pinch of snuff. \u201CBut please, enough about my troubles, you are here
    to learn of your fiance, <i>non</i>?\u201D"
  - "Pierre scowls at you for a fraction of a second, before breaking out into a wide
    and almost-sympathetic grin. \u201CMadame, but if only I could! I would pay for
    your gracious insights with bars of silver, and fistfuls of rubies, as that is
    what they are worth!\u201D"
  - "He gestures to his dilapidated and stained office. \u201CHowever, while the pursuit
    of truth may make a man virtuous, it does not make him wealthy. The coins I give
    are all I can spare, as I need all that remains to keep the wheels of my press
    turning.\u201D"
  - "While the empty liquor bottles laying on the ground make you doubt his honesty
    a little, you get the feeling that he isn\u2019t going to budge on this."
  - "\u201CBut please, enough about such ignoble matters, you are here to learn of
    your fiance, <i>non</i>?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI like to think we\u2019ve made good business partners, <i>non</i>?\u201D"
  - Pierre puts down his snuff box and favors you with a deep and theatrical bow.
    "Now you flatter me madame. <i>Bonne chance</i> madame, and may God see fit to
    reunite you with your Armand in great haste."
  - "Pierre nods and grins, \u201CBut, of course, Madame! It is merely business, but
    I still hope it is good business. <i>Adieu</i>, madame!\u201D"
  - "At the mention of God, Pierre makes the sign of the cross, but you\u2019re pretty
    sure he did it backwards. \"<i>Adieu</i> madame, and may our paths cross again!\""
  - '"In fact, your contributions have been so great that they must be recognized.
    Madame Decaux, you are no longer a mere gossip monger..."'
  - (You have reached the rank of 'Journalist' at <i>Le Trompette du Peuple</i>. The
    title itself is meaningless, but it certainly sounds nice.)
  - '"Today, you are a journalist!"'
