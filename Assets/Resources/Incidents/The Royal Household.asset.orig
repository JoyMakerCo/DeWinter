  - "You approach a pair of women who are already in the midst of conversation, speaking
    quickly in low voices. They don\u2019t seem to have noticed you."
  - "\u201CIt\u2019s been days since the Queen has made any official appearances at
    Versailles.\u201D One the women fiercely whispers to the other. \u201CIt is said
    that the <i>Dauphin\u2019s</i> health is worsening, and she spends every minute
    by his side.\u201D "
  - "Your ears perk up at this. The Queen\u2019s eldest son is only seven years old,
    but he\u2019s been afflicted with consumption for years now. Rumors don\u2019t
    have much value, but if there\u2019s some evidence to this claim, then this could
    be valuable Gossip indeed.\r"
  - "\u201CHe\u2019s overcome the condition before, perhaps he\u2019ll do it again?\u201D"
  - "Your brother never actually came down with the illness, but he\u2019s not here
    to contest that fact. You smile and pretend to be oblivious as to who they\u2019re
    discussing, so as to mask your intent.\r"
  - "You sip your wine and pretend to be admiring a nearby vase, while keeping your
    ears perked up and focused on the womens\u2019 conversation.\r\n\r\nThey don\u2019t
    seem to suspect a thing.\r"
  - "You decide against engaging them in conversation, or listening in. While it\u2019s
    nice to have some reliable gossip, you don\u2019t need it that badly right now.
    Instead, you spend some time wandering about the party, sipping at your wine,
    taking in the sights and the sounds."
  - "\u201CWell, our\u2026 friend\u2019s son has been sick for quite some time now,
    and she\u2019s been taking it quite hard. I recently heard that she privately
    vowed not to leave her son\u2019s side until he slept through the night, but she\u2019s
    been with him for over a week. He keeps waking up in fits of coughing.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CWell, our\u2026 friend\u2019s son has been sick for quite some time now,
    and-\u201D one woman starts cautiously."
  - "You continue to chat with them as they dance around the issue of who, exactly,
    you\u2019re talking about. You helpfully offer up some home remedies for coughing
    fits that you\u2019ve heard in the past, and they act as grateful as ettiquette
    requires."
  - "Eventually, you part ways with each other, so you can explore the rest of the
    party. \r"
  - "The other woman suddenly steps in between the two of you and cuts off her companion.
    \u201CI\u2019m sorry, but this is a private matter. I\u2019m glad your brother
    is doing well, please give him our regards.\u201D Her smile is cold, and her posture
    stiff. "
  - "Guiding her friend gently by the elbow, they disappear off into a different corner
    of the party, judging you all the way.\r"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m not so sure, a handmaiden told me that the Queen privately vowed
    not to leave her son\u2019s side until he slept through the night, but she\u2019s
    been with him for over a week. He keeps waking up in fits of coughing.\u201D\r\n\r\nVows.
    Specific details. Lives in the balance. Now that\u2019s what makes good gossip!\r"
  - "You listen to them go back and forth for a little while, and you hungrily soak
    up all the details to this story that you can. Eventually, you realize that you\u2019ve
    been admiring this vase for a suspicious amount of time."
  - "\u201COh, I\u2019m sorry, did we interrupt something?\u201D One of them asks,
    arching a single eyebrow imposingly. "
  - "\u201CI think this conversation would best be continued somewhere more discreet.\u201D
    The other woman intimates to her companion."
  - "They disappear off into a different corner of the party, judging you all the
    way.\r"
  - "(A new piece of gossip has been added to your inventory. You\x19'll be able to
    use this later.)\r"
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - "(You have lost some credibility)\r"
  - "(A new piece of gossip has been added to your inventory. You\x19'll be able to
    use this later.)\r"
  - "You nod with the appropriate look of concern, while hungrily memorizing details.
    The Queen swearing vows. Lives hanging in the balance. This is what makes quality
    gossip!\r"
