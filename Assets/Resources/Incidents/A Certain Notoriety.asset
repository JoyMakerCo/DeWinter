  - "You wake up the next morning to a polite knock on your bedroom\u2019s door frame."
  - "Camille enters, carrying a small armload of letters.\n\n\u201CUh\u2026 madame.\u201D
    Camille starts, both confused and hesitant."
  - "\u201CThey\u2019re for you, madame! Every single one!\u201D Camille beams."
  - "You\u2019re don\u2019t think that\u2019s exactly how it happened, but decide
    against fretting over the details."
  - "Camille starts to talk faster and faster. \u201CThen, when all was lost, you
    were saved by a beautiful stranger who escorted you home in the moonlit night!
    It\u2019s so romantic, <i>non</i>?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, the rumors are already running rampant! Why, just in the market the
    other day I heard someone say that you\u2019ve taken a liking to-\u201D"
  - "Camille stops, stares into space, and blushes. \u201CActually, nevermind that.\u201D"
  - "\u201C...it\u2019s just rumors from the marketplace madame, nothing you should
    dignify.\u201D"
  - "\u201CConsider it... un-minded, madame.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIn fact, I\u2019m sure that anyone who really judges you fairly is going
    to love you.\u201D"
  - With that, your day begins.
  - '"Don''t worry, madame! It''s quite simple!"'
  - "\u201CThere\u2019s a lot of letters for you here.\u201D"
  - "The letter, written in elaborate calligraphy and sealed in stamped wax, appears
    to be an invitation to a party. The other letters cradled in Camille\u2019s arms
    appear to be the same."
  - "\u201CWell madame, you\u2019re a little famous right now,\u201D Camille replies.
    \u201CEveryone\u2019s heard about your run-in with that dreadful party host a
    few days ago. How they preyed upon your honor, and spirited away your carriage
    driver, leaving you trapped and alone.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIn any case, this is your chance to meet people in the city who don\u2019t
    hate you and Armand.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWell, yes madame. These could go badly,\u201D Camille admits. \u201CNot
    everyone in the city is particularly honest. In fact, most people of your station
    tend to have a lot of enemies.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHowever...\u201D she continues. \u201CThat dreadful host must have enemies
    too!\u201D"
  - "\u201CAll these invitations must come from people who hate that vile person as
    much as we do!\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m certain of it, madame. This is your chance to meet people in the
    city who don\u2019t hate you and Armand.\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CMadame, you\u2019re the mistress of this house,\u201D Camille states matter
    of factly. \u201CI can\u2019t allow any insult against your honor to go unchallenged.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI know that you hate them, so I hate them as well. In fact, I have already
    sworn to never speak their name again!\u201D"
  - "\u201C... but I\u2019m getting off topic, madame. I think that these invitations
    are your chance to meet good people in the city who don\u2019t hate you and Armand.\u201D
