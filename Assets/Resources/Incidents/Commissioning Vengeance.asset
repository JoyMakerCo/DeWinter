    is that she\u2019s doing in her head.\r"

    \u201CI\u2019ll warn you now, I don\u2019t paint nudes of my clients.\u201D"
  - "\u201CSketching in my head. There\u2019s a woman over there with some very interesting
    features.\u201D She points across the room at the woman in question, obvious enough
    that anyone could notice, but nobody seems willing to make a fuss about it.\r"
  - "\u201CEven though you\u2019d make a very intriguing subject.\u201D"
  - "She rubs her chin thoughtfully, then takes out an actual sketchbook and starts
    to flip through it, examining old ideas. \u201CA mother with son?\u201D\r"

  - "\u201CTHE Baron de Termes? Ugh\u2026\u201D"
  - "She starts sketching a little. \u201CEvery artist faces the same problem. You
    spend your whole life making beautiful things, but you\u2019re never sure that
    anything you\u2019re doing actually matters.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CLots of people like my paintings, even important people like the Queen.
    Still, I\u2019m always wondering if I\u2019m actually making the world a better
    place.\u201D "
  - "\u201CA more beautiful one? Definitely. A better one? I\u2019m not sure.\u201D
    Her sketching starts to speed up."
  - "\u201CThis, on the other hand. This is exactly what I\u2019ve been looking for!\u201D "
  - "\u201CA painting that actually solves a problem in someone\u2019s life. Oh, this
    will be some of my best work...\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CSorry, I got carried away there. I will absolutely paint this. Where can
    I find my subjects, and what, exactly, does this painting need to convey to the
    viewer?\u201D\r"
  - "You spend a few minutes telling \xC9lisabeth about where to find Marguerite Bonnet,
    and what exactly the painting needs to display. \r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t know how
    you\u2019ll use this painting yet, but it still means that you\u2019re a step
    closer than \ryou were before."

  - "\u201CSorry, I just hate that man. Did you know that he called one of my self
    portraits \u2018uninspired and selfish\u2019?\u201D"
  - "\u201CIt\u2019s a self portrait! People have been painting them for\u2026 forever!
    It\u2019s a classic display of an artist\u2019s skills!\u201D She takes a sip
    of wine and grumbles to herself. \u201CHonestly, how come when men paint pictures
    of themselves they\u2019re \u2018engaging in a serious study\u2019, but when I
    paint one, it\u2019s suddenly all about my vanity?\u201D "
  - "\u201C...\u201D"
  - "\u201CSorry, I got carried away there. I will absolutely paint this, if it means
