  _nodeText:
  - "Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\xE9rigord, or simply 'Talleyrand' is figure
    of much discussion in France. Born as the scion to a powerful noble family, Talleyrand's
    foot was maimed at an early age in an accident. Unable to participate in the
    dances of the courtiers, or march adequately enough to serve in the military,
    he was deemed useless by his family. Thus, he was sent into the priesthood, like
    many unwanted sons of nobility."
  - While he's fulfilled his duties to the Church well, he's also been the subject
    of much scandal. Talleyrand believes that he embodies a modern system of Catholic
    values, including his preferences towards the needs of the common people over
    the nobility.
  - However, actual advancement within the Church has evaded him for some time. While
    it's well-known that he's been impatiently waiting for the Archbishop of Bourges
    to finally join the heavenly host, Talleyrand has also had his eye on the post
    of the Bishop of Autun.
  - Unfortunately for him, it seems that Talleyrand's prayers have gone unanswered.
    While the Bishop of Autun has moved to Lyon, he's selected a different successor
    to his post. This has left the ambitious Talleyrand fuming, and the more orthodox
    members of the clergy laughing behind their hands.
  - A few days ago, his pious prayers were answered, and the Bishop of Autun moved
    to Leon. This opening has made Talleyrand the new bishop, and given him all of
    the power he wanted. This includes a wealth of property, and a salary of nearly
    fifty thousand livres a year.
  - The Revolution has gained a powerful ally within the Church, but the credibility
    of the Church has been damaged, for reasons that don't require divine insight
    to perceive.
  - '(The Church has lost a little power)

    (The Church has moved towards the
    Revolution by a decent amount)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - '(The Church has gained some power)

    (The Church has moved towards the Crown
    a little)'
  - It appears that the traditionalists in the Church have won this day, and the
    Revolution has lost the chance to have a powerful ally.
  - Of course, this has caused some uproar, as Talleyrand has never even been to
    Autun. Ignoring his critics, he spent the evening celebrating this turn of good
    fortune by dining with his mistress in the Louvre.
  - However, these 'modern views' seem to be dismissive of his vows of celibacy.
    Despite the infirmities that caused his family to dismiss him, he's still been
    considered quite desirable by many women in France, due to his kindness, erudition,
    and snapping witticisms.
