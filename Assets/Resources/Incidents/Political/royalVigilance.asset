  - 'As one might imagine, His Majesty King Louis XVI is a subject of much attention
    during the Estates General. Which is by design. He''s on a throne, which is on
    a platform, at the head of the entire chamber.


    Much of royal power seems
    to come from making sure that you can''t be ignored.'
  - The daily debates over the details of extremely particular issues are dragging
    on for a long time. However, there is still a level of anticipation in the air.
    For most of the assembled representatives, this is their first chance to actually
    see the thirty-three year old king's ability to rule, in person.
  - Which is rather unfortunate, because that meant that every member of the assembled
    estates noticed when His Majesty fell asleep on his throne during one of the
    debates.
  - However, despite the drudgery and tiresome revisiting of the same issues, over
    and over again, His Majesty has remained sharp, alert, and incisive.
  - '(The Crown has lost some power)

    (The Revolution has gained some power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - This comical lapse has only aided the Revolution's rhetoric that the Third Estate
    is taking the concerns of the people far more seriously than the Crown and the
    Second Estate.
  - 'There''s been a variety of people who''ve dared to whisper that the king was
    distracted, vassilating, and irresolute, but this latest display seems to have
    put a halt to such claims.


    At least, for the moment.'
  - '(The Crown has gained some power)

    (The Revolution has lost some power)'
