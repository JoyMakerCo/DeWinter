  _nodeText:
  - It's a well-known secret that certain priests manage their parish as if it were
    their own personal estate. The Catholic Church tends to overlook such worldly
    indiscretions, but there are limits.
  - A bishop in Lyon was recently caught embezzling a significant amount of funds
    from the Church, and there are rumors that he was attempting to sell a holy relic
    to a private collector. This latest embarrassment has forced his superiors to
    act.
  - Shockingly, the bishop's superiors acted in the strongest terms. Not only has
    the Pope ordered the bishop to be immediately defrocked, the now former priest
    has been seized and sent to Rome to await trial. The common people have reacted
    well to this harsh treatment of corruption, and seem to show renewed faith in
    the Church.
  - Unfortunately, it seems that his punishment will be almost entirely spiritual
    in nature. After being forced to return the lost funds, the bishop was simply
    shuffled to a position in a different province, without any additional censure.
    This flagrant apathy towards corruption has damaged the people's faith in the
    Church.
  - (The Church has lost some power)
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - (The Church has gained some power)
