  - "Today, the talk of Paris is that Honor\xE9 Riqueti the <i>Comte de Mirabeau</>,
    is representing the Third Estate in the Estates General. Known more simply as
    'Mirabeau', he's been a outspoken supporter of the Revolution for a long time."
  - Of course, the most suprising thing is that he was legally allowed to return
    to the country at all, or that nobody has killed him yet. Despite his work ethic,
    measured political stances, and his talents as an orator, the man's caustic wit
    tends to make him enemies at a pace greater than even your own.
  - Against all odds, Mirabeau has managed to restrain himself amidst the heated
    discussions, and occassionally even served as the voice of reason. Rumors abound
    of the Queen even attempting to bribe Mirabeau as part of some scheme to undermine
    the Third Estate, but you're not sure if there's any substance to them.
  - '(The Revolution has gained some power)

    (The Crown has lost some power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - Unfortunately, that very wit got ahead of him, when became embroiled in a fight
    with a representative of the First Estate, one Talleyrand.
  - '(The Revolution has lost some power)

    (The Church has moved away from the
    Revolution a little)'
  - "At the height of this disagreement, Mirabeau loudly proclaimed that the priest
    Talleyrand \u201Cwould sell his own soul for money and he would be right, for
    he would be exchanging shit for gold.\" \n\nWhether or not this is true, it doesn't
    make the Revolution look good."
  - Regardless, Mirabeau has made the Revolution seem extremely competent.
