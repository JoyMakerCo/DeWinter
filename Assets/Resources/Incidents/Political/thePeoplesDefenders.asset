  _nodeText:
  - Bandits have always been a problem in France, but the growing famine has only
    encouraged more desperate people to prey upon roving travelers. Things reached
    a head recently, when one bold group of highwaymen began committing robberies
    just outside of Paris itself.
  - "A few days ago, the Military dispatched the Queen\u2019s Royal Dragoons to bring
    these brigands to heel."
  - The dragoons dispersed the bandits quickly, and without incident. This easy victory
    has strengthened the people's faith in the Military.
  - While the dragoons easily captured the bandits, news has reached the public that
    this group of criminals was composed almost entirely of former soldiers, who
    fought in the American War of Independence. The public has reacted poorly to
    this revelation, and many wonder why they should place their faith in people
    so quick to turn against them.
  - (The Military has lost some power)
  - (The Military has gained some power)
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
