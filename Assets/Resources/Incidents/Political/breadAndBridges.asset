  - 'It''s no small secret that the hunger of the countryside has reached Paris. '
  - The King, in an attempt to provide some relief to the citizens of the city, ordered
    the Pont Neuf closed down and a place to distribute bread set up as a public
    relief effort.
  - The bridge was, of course, immediately flooded with people.
  - The bridge was, of course, immediately flooded with people.
  - (The Crown has lost some power)
  - (The Crown has gained some power)
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - These bread wagons only had enough food for a few days, but the gesture was still
    well received. While it certainly wasn't a long term solution, it showed the
    people that the Crown cared enough to act on behalf of its neediest citizens.
  - The bread wagons ran out of bread on the first day, and the lines were plagued
    with frauds trying to cheat the relief workers into giving them multiple loaves.
    Enraged, the crowds quickly overwhelmed the meager guards set up to keep order,
    and threw the empty bread carts into the river. Many went to sleep with bellies
    empty of food, but hearts stuffed with resentment.
