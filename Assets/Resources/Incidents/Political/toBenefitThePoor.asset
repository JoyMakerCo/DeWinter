  _nodeText:
  - With the threat of famine continuing to grow, a prominent entepeneur in the Bourgeoisie,
    one Monsieur Riquet, hosted a charity auction where he sold nearly his entire
    art collection to help feed the poor.
  - This noble endeavor attracted much attention, and has been covered by many of
    the most prominent newspapers. In fact, it was such an exclusive event that they
    even sent Pierre a letter preemptively forbidding him from attending.
  - The auction went exceedingly well, and was enough to supply a good amount of
    Paris' poorest citizens with enough bread to last the week. Hardly a remedy for
    a national crisis, but it showed that the members of the Bourgeoisie not only
    care about their fellow commoners, but they have the ability to actually do something
    worthwhile.
  - Unfortunately, despite the auction being well attended by those seeking to see
    and be seen, it seems that it wasn't attended by many people actually intending
    to spend money for a good cause. This failure of personal charity has made Monsieur
    Riquet look quite the fool, and made the Bourgeoisie seem ineffective in the
    face of a true crisis.
  - (The Bourgeoisie has gained some power)
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - (The Bourgeoisie has lost some power)
