  _nodeText:
  - Last night, a mysterious fire erupted in the city, consuming an art studio. Rumor
    has it that this studio was raided by the <i>Guet Royal</i>, then left abandoned.
    Considering how easily fires spread in a densely packed city of wooden buildings,
    tensions around the situation have been high.
  - To that end, some of the nearby buildings sustained damage, but the studio itself
    was razed to the ground. The <i>Guet Royal</i> suspect that this was arson, and
    are demanding that the public come forth with any information that would lead
    to the criminal responsible.
  - The whole situation seems utterly random, and bizarre to you.
  - You almost immediately recognize the studio as the one Pierre told you about
    earlier. This mysterious hotbed of political artists that Armand had been attending
    meetings in. It's a shame, as there'll be nothing for you to find there now,
    other than embers and ashes.
  - You almost immediately recognize the studio as the one you searched for evidence
    of Armand, earlier on. It's a testament to your instincts that you searched the
    building while you still had the chance.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - (The Abandoned Studio is no longer available for you to visit on the Paris Map)
  - Whoever burned that studio down was trying to hide something. Which means that
    there was something there that the arsonist was willing to risk setting an entire
    city block ablaze to conceal.
  - You spend some time puzzling over why someone would bother to burn down an abandoned
    building, but fail to reach any sort of useful conclusion. The whole thing seems
    utterly senseless.
  - It's good that you found the evidence when you did, and speaks to the value of
    the cryptic letter and signet ring that you found under the floorboards in your
    kitchen afterwards. What could they truly mean?
  - To that end, you still need to read the note that you found in that studio. Perhaps
    it's connected to whatever this arsonist wished so desperately to hide?
