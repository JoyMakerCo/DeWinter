  _nodeText:
  - Yesterday, a whole company of soldiers from the <i>gardes francaise</i> marched
    to the <i>Palais-Royal</i> to publicly announce that they would, under no circumstances,
    fire upon the people.
  - 'This noble declaration raised equal parts celebration and alarm from the common
    people. After all, they would only make such a statement is they''d been recently
    ordered to fire upon the people, but only just refused the order. '
  - "Later that day, a group of the soldiers from that very company  approached the
    National Assembly to publicly denounce their own commanding officer, the <i>Duc
    de Ch\xE2telet</i>, as an enemy of the people.\n\nAfterwards, they were quickly
    apprehended by the soldiers still loyal to the Crown, and arrested."
  - "News of this spread like wildfire, and soon a mob of angry citizens had gathered
    outside the prison where they were being held. This mob grew to be so large and
    enraged that the commander of the prison was forced to relent and release them,
    instead of risking a bloodbath. \n\nThe soldiers spent only a day in prison, before
    they were released to riotous applause and celebration. "
  - '(The Military has lost a little power)

    (The Military has moved towards the Revolution by a decent amount)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - While there was public outrage at the imprisonment of these soldiers, the Crown
    has refused to yield. In fact, reinforcements were sent to the prison where the
    mutinous men were being held, and many protestors outisde the prison have found
    themselves arrested as well.
  - '(The Crown has gained a little power)

    (The Military has moved towards the Crown by a decent amount)'
  - "Later that day, a group of the soldiers from that very company  approached the
    Estates General to publicly denounce their own commanding officer, the <i>Duc
    de Ch\xE2telet</i> as an enemy of the people.\n\nWhile their proclamations could
    be heard through the doors, they never got past the guards into the assembly room,
    and were arrested."
  - 'The wave of public sentiment reached such heights that the <i>Duc d''Orleans</i>
    even plans to throw the released soldiers a banquet to celebrate their heroism
    in the face of tyranny. Needless to say, this has made the Military establishment
    looks foolish indeed. It has also given many common soldiers cause to investigate
    their own loyalties.


    Who do they actually fight for?'
  - At the direct request of the Crown, the Military has imposed stern disciplinary
    measures, to quell further defiance. This is not something they can allow to get
    out of hand.
