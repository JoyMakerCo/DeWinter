  - The Bastille, a looming castle that was once the most infamous prison in all of
    Paris. Though it barely fills its role as a prison anymore, many still consider
    it a symbol of tyranny. Of repression.
  - Today, a mob of over a thousand commoners, armed with pikes, kitchen implements,
    and stolen rifles, attempted to storm the fortress. The Bastille contains hundreds
    of rifles, dozens of cannons, and ammunition for all of them. It's also extremely
    undermanned.
  - Camped on the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, on the other side of the river Seine, are
    five thousand troops in service to the Crown, armed and ready for battle. Barely
    a mile away, if they decide to cross the river to relieve the defenders of the
    Bastille, nothing would be able to stop them.
  - And that's exactly what they do.
  - 'However, that''s not as easy a decision as it seems. The Bastille isn''t just
    being assaulted by a peasant mob. They''ve been joined by an entire unit of French
    Guard deserters, armed with rifles, cannons, and tactical expertise. '
  - On the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, the commander of the relief force looks out at his
    own men, and wonders how many of them are sympathetic to the revolutionary cause.
    If he brought his troops to the Bastille, how many of them would be willing to
    fire on French citizens? Would he be defending the Bastille, or just adding to
    the numbers of the attackers?
  - This question paralyzes him... and he does nothing.
  - By the end of the day, the Bastille has been overwhelmed, and the <i>Bourgeois
    Militia</i> has more than enough weapons to arm itself
  - The guards number barely more than a hundred.
  - '(The Revolution has gained a staggering amount of power)

    (The Crown has lost a staggering amount of power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life is changed forever.
  - At their commander's word, the five thousand troops form up and begin a swift
    march across the <i>Pont Sully</i>. They are grim, and determined to restore order
    at any cost.
  - Seeing this enormous force crossing the bridge, many of the attacking militia
    scatter, and those who don't are quickly trapped in the square surrounding the
    fortress. The relief force strikes like a hammer, shattering the nascent citizen
    army against the looming walls of the Bastille.
  - By the end of the day, bodies litter the streets, and the revolutionaries have
    gained hundreds of martyrs to their cause. They have lost the first great battle,
    but it's too late for them to turn back now.
  - '(The Crown has gained a staggering amount of power)

    (The Revolution has lost a staggering amount of power)'
