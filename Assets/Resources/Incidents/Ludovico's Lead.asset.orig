  _nodeText:
  - "You leave the house earlier than usual that morning, uncertain of how long it\u2019ll
    take you to walk to the fountain that Ludovico mentioned in his letter to you."
  - "Given that you\u2019re still new to skullduggery, you decided to dress in darker
    clothes, and stuck to comfortable walking shoes."
  - "Surprisingly enough, you manage to find the fountain without getting turned around.
    It seems like the perfect place for a meeting like this. There\u2019s just enough
    people wandering around that you won\u2019t draw attention, but also few enough
    that you\u2019ll be able to find somewhere secluded to talk."
  - "Looking around, you can\u2019t spot Ludovico anywhere, so you decide to take
    a seat at the edge of the fountain. It makes sense to be visible enough that he\u2019ll
    be able to find you without any flashy waving or signalling. "
  - "You get comfortable, smooth out your skirts and pause for a moment to reflect
    on the decisions that led you to a point in your life where you\u2019re having
    secret rendezvous with priests to learn more about your hated enemies. If anything,
    they must have been good decisions."
  - "Some time later, after you\u2019ve waved away a particularly enthusiastic tea
    salesman for the third time, a familiar face emerges from behind the shadows of
    a tree.\n\n\u201C<i>Bonjour</i>, madame\u201D he nods pleasantly. \u201CYou seem
    troubled.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIs there anything this humble priest can help you with?\u201D"
  - "\u201CThat is an excellent idea madame. Please lead the way.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThat\u2026\u201D"
  - "You find a quiet corner in the square to speak with Ludovico. He opens the book
    he\u2019s carrying and reads over some sort of list he\u2019s keeping in it."
  - "\u201CAs I said before, I\u2019m sorry for everything that happened to you. Something
    about Maximin\u2019s smug demeanour has always rubbed me the wrong way, even ignoring
    all of his snide remarks about the church.\u201D"
  - "\u201C... is a very good point,\u201D he admits with a defeated sigh. You can
    tell that he was quite enjoying this air of intrigue, but you need results. Ludovico
    sits down next to you and composes himself."
  - "\u201CWith that in mind I started asking around about him, seeing if his revolutionary
    righteousness was real, or a mere facade.\u201D He favors you with a sly smile.
    \u201CAt first I thought it would be difficult to interview so many people, but
    you\u2019d be amazed at what people are willing to tell a simple priest.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhile it\u2019s nothing solid, I think you\u2019ll be very interested in
    the fact that Maximin\u2019s household goes through servants quite quickly.\u201D
    He hands you a list of names, presumably of servants that used to work for Maximin.
    \u201CThere\u2019s the usual complaints about long hours, skipped wages, and general
    unpleasantness. However, one of them stood out to me, simply because of how few
    details I could find.\u201D"
  - "\u201CA servant leaving their master, under mysterious circumstances\u2026 if
    Maximin has a dark secret then this is it.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThink nothing of it madame, I\u2019m just trying to do the right thing.\u201D"
  - "Ludovico leans in close and whispers in your ear, his voice barely audible. \u201CMadame,
    Rome chose me as their eyes and ears in France. You didn\u2019t think that they\u2019d
    sent someone who\u2019s never gotten their hands dirty, did you?\u201D"
  - "You\u2019re not sure if Ludovico helping you exact your revenge could really
    be classified as \u2018the right thing\u2019, but you\u2019re not going to complain."
  - "\u201CWhile I must go, be warned that tracking this person down will not be easy.
    I couldn\u2019t find any information about this mystery servant. Not their name,
    where they live, or even the position they held in Maximin\u2019s home. Still,
    I will pray for your success.\u201D"
  - "\u201C...\u201D"
  - "\u201CHaha! Sorry, I\u2019ve always wanted to say something like that.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonestly, it\u2019s been a nice change of pace, normally I just spend a
    lot of time listening to bishops and writing letters back to the Vatican. This
    has me out and about, enjoying Paris, and getting a feel for its people.\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Ciao</i>, madame.\u201D Ludovico says before leaving."
  - "You stop to think about this new information. A mystery servant, who left Maximin\u2019s
    employment suddenly, and under murky circumstances. It seems fruitful, but you\u2019ll
    have to dig deeper first."
  - (You have lost a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (Researching Maximin is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - With that, you start to head home, already planning your next move against your
    sworn enemy.
