  _nodeText:
  - Pierre is staring at you. You must have gotten lost in your thoughts for a moment.
  - "\u201CUh\u2026 Madame, I was asking \u2018How well do you know your fiance?\u2019\u201D"
  - "\u201CEven after all of this anguish, you still feel this way towards him?\u201D
    Pierre asks, his shock barely concealed. \u201CSuch lasting affection, in this
    modern age, is quite rare.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWell Madame, I would say that in times of uncertainty, you should always
    seek the truth,\u201D Pierre replies quietly, leaning closer. \u201CThe truth
    may hurt you now, but lies will always hurt more later.\u201D"
  - "Pierre notes your confusion and for a moment, almost looks sympathetic \u201CWell
    Madame, perhaps it\u2019s time that you learned as much as you can. Which is something
    I can certainly help with.\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou see, I\u2019m looking to run a comprehensive social piece, something
    that will capture the imagination of the public,\u201D Pierre favors you with
    a broad, toothy grin \u201CIt may also rekindle some old rivalries, so to speak.
    After all, it\u2019s easier to sell newspapers when there\u2019s something to
    write about.\u201D"
  - "Pierre puffs out his chest, and strikes a heroic pose \u201CI shall do my best
    to reunite you with your lost Armand, as it has often been rightly said that I
    am a man dedicated to the causes of truth, and love!\u201D"
  - "You look Pierre up and down, not really certain if anybody has described him
    in that way\u2026 ever."
  - "\u201COf course, I cannot work for free.\u201D Pierre admits, shifting awkwardly
    from foot to foot. \u201CI must support my newspaper, after all. But if you help
    me with this, I will help you as best I can.\u201D"
  - "\u201COf course, I cannot work for free, as my esteemed newspaper comes first.
    However, I can still provide you with some good leads, in exchange for your help.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIf you bring me gossip related to all five of the factions in this city,
    the Crown, the Church, the Military, the Bourgeoisie, and the Revolutionaries,
    I will tell you where to learn more about your estranged Armand.\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou do not need to get me this gossip all at once, you just need to get
    me each piece while it\u2019s still relevant, and my journalistic genius shall
    handle the rest.\u201D"
  - "\u201CNow then, to business?\u201D"
  _linkText:
  - 
  - "\u201CI know Armand better than anyone, and I know he\u2019s a good man.\u201D"
  - "\u201CSomething\u2019s not right with Armand. I just don\u2019t feel like I can
    trust him entirely.\u201D"
  - "\u201CPerhaps I don\u2019t know him as well as I thought.\u201D"
