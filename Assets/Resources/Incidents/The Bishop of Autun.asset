  _nodeText:
  - "Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\xE9rigord, or simply 'Talleyrand' is figure of
    much discussion in France. Born as the scion to a powerful noble family, his foot
    was maimed at an early age in an accident. Unable to particapte in the courtly
    dances of the courtiers, or march adequately enough to serve in the military,
    he was deemed useless by his family. Thus, he was sent into the priesthood, like
    many unwanted sons of nobility."
  - While he's fulfilled his duties to the Church well, he's also been the subject
    of much scandal. Talleyrand believes that he embodies a modern system of Catholic
    values, including his preferences towards the needs of the common people over
    the nobility. However, these modern views seem to be dismissive of his vows of
    celibacy. Despite the infirmities that caused his family to dismiss him, he's
    still been considered quite desirable by many women in France, due to his kindness,
    erudition, and snapping witicisms.
  - However, actual advancement within the Church has evaded him for some time. While
    it's well known that he's been impatiently waiting for the Archbishop of Bourges
    to finally join the heavenly host, Talleyrand has also had his eye on the post
    of the Bishop of Autun.
  - Unfortunately for him, it seems that Talleyrand's prayers have gone unanswered.
    While the Bishop of Autun has moved to Lyon, he's selected a different successor
    to his post. This has left the ambitious Talleyrand fuming, and the more orthodox
    members of the clergy laughing behind their hands.
  - 'A few days ago, his pious prayers were answered, and the Bishop of Autun moved
    to Leon. This opening has made made Talleyrand the new bishop, and given him all
    of the power he wanted. This includes a wealth of property, and a salary of nearly
    fifty thousrand livres a year. '
  - The Revolution has gained a powerful ally within the Church, but the credibility
    of the Church has been damaged, for reasons that don't require divine insight
    to perceive.
  - '(The Church has lost a little power)

    (The Church has moved towards the Revolution by a decent amount)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - '(The Church has gained some power)

    (The Church has moved towards the Crown a little)'
  - It appears that the traditionalists in the Church have won this day, and the Revolution
    has lost the chance to have a powerful ally.
  - Of course, this has caused some uproar, as Talleyrand has never even been to Autun.
    Ignoring his critics, he spent the evening celebrating this turn of good fortune
    by dining with his mistress in the Louvre.
