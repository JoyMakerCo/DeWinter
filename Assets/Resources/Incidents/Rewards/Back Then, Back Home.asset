  _nodeText:
  - "It's early February, and you take a seat at your usual spot in <i>\u2018Le Cygne\u2019</i>,
    a small tavern in your hometown. The hood of your cloak is still up, but it\u2019s
    less to do with the snow outside and more to do with the fact that you don\u2019t
    want to talk to anyone else here."
  - After a few minutes of trying to read your book, but failing to really get into
    it, you hear a set of footsteps approaching your table.
  - "\u201C<i>Bonjour</i> Yvette, I hope you weren\u2019t waiting too long.\u201D"
  - "\u201CExcellent! This is our last night together for a while, so I want to make
    sure that it\u2019s a memory we\u2019ll treasure.\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Je suis d\xE9sol\xE9 mon cher</i>, it\u2019s taken so much longer to
    get my affairs in order than I thought. Now I\u2019m already spoiling our last
    night.\u201D"
  - "Armand fills your glass first. \u201CMy father\u2019s been talking my ear off
    about this particular vintage. I hope it\u2019s up to your standards.\u201D"
  - "He then fills his own, then raises his glass for a toast. \u201CTo France, to
    the general assembly, but most importantly, to us!\u201D"
  - "The red wine is deep and full bodied, it smells of leather, blackberries and
    cloves. It\u2019s some of the best you\u2019ve had, and you can tell that Armand
    is enjoying it as well. "
  - "You spend an hour finishing the bottle together, pausing occasionally to nibble
    at the bread. All the while, you trade jokes, news from around the village, and
    simply try to forget that this is the last you\u2019ll see of each other for months."
  - "With the wine finished, Armand pauses to place the bottle on its side, a curious
    habit he picked up from his father. He then takes a deep breath, and waits a moment
    before saying \u201CThe snow appears to have stopped. Would you\u2026 would you
    like to join me outside? I have something I want to show you.\u201D"
  - "Armand gives an audible sigh of relief, while he usually cares about keeping
    his appointments, he rarely let\u2019s something like this get to him. \"I'm sorry,
    it\u2019s just\u2026 the Estates General is important, but so are you. I'm packing
    and writing letters night and day in order to get ready, but all the time I spend
    on that is time I'm not spending with you.\""
  - "\u201CI knew it...\u201D Armand sighs, defeated."
  - "He pauses, and takes a deep breath. \u201CEnough of that! If I want to feel sorry
    for myself, I can do it on the carriage to Paris. Tonight is for making sweet
    memories.\u201D"
  - "Suddenly he begins to perk up, and leans in close to whisper. \u201CYou\u2019ll
    finally leave this place behind, living as a lonely hermit, far from the prying
    eyes of civilization. At night, children will whisper of the beautiful, wicked
    woman living in the forest, who reviles all of society.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHow will you pass your time alone in the woods?\u201D"
  - "Armand is more animate now, his words coming out faster and faster \u201CIn that
    case, I shall have no choice but to disguise myself as a huntsman, lost in the
    forest, and happening upon your grand salon by chance. You might be intrigued
    by this curious outsider in your midst. This would lead us to talking amongst
    the birds, the deer, and your other refined guests about the natural order, and
    the beauties of the wilds.\u201D"
  - "Armand leans in, his eyebrow raised conspiratorially, \u201CAh, but your evil
    ways would not go unnoticed for long. The whole town would live in fear of you,
    and as the heir to this Barony I would have no choice but stop you myself. I would
    disguise myself as a huntsman, lost in the forest and pretend to be blissfully
    unaware of your wicked predations. While I would be unable to resist your charms,
    I feel that\u2026 you might feel the same way about me.\u201D"
  - "\u201CObviously, I would be unable to resist your charms. Perhaps\u2026 you would
    feel same?\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat say you, wicked woman of the woods? Would you be swayed by this huntsman\u2019s
    charms?\u201D"
  - "\u201CAh, the kindling embers of true love would be reignited into a roaring
    flame. I would cast off my disguise, and you would completely forgive me for being
    late.\u201D"
  - "Armand sighs, \u201COh, a tragic ending for our hero. If only he had never been
    late to see his captivating fiance, this never would have happened.\u201D"
  - "He waves to barmaid, who brings you a bottle of wine and some glasses, along
    with a loaf of freshly baked bread that\u2019s still steaming when it touches
    the table. Armand fills your glass first."
  - "He then fills his own, then raises his glass for a toast. \u201CTo happy endings,
    may our lives turn out as well as they do in the stories.\u201D"
  - "He waves to barmaid, who brings you a bottle of wine and some glasses, along
    with a loaf of freshly baked bread that\u2019s still steaming when it touches
    the table. Armand fills your glass first."
  - "He then fills his own, then raises his glass for a toast. \u201CTo the loss of
    our hero, destroyed by that which he loved the most.\u201D"
  - "Outside the night air is brisk, even the colors of the moonlit sky are cold.
    It\u2019s a stark contrast from the fireside warmth of the tavern. Yet, despite
    the open air, it feels more intimate and personal than the small tavern you\u2019ve
    left behind."
  - "\u201CWhile I like <i>Le Cygne</i> as much as the next man, I\u2019d prefer to
    end our night with something that\u2019s just about us.\u201D Armand says in a
    soft, low voice."
  - "He turns and holds out his elbow for you to grab onto, \u201CCare for a walk?\u201D"
  - You step in close to him, wrapping your arm around his, before you both wander
    off into the moonlit night.
  - "Armand smiles, \u201CVery well, Madame!\u201D. \n\nThere\u2019s not much in the
    way of benches outside the tavern, but he finds a stone mounting block a short
    distance away that will serve just as well."
  - "You walk along the edge of a lake, the only sound being the chirping of the crickets,
    the sounds of your footfalls, and the steady rhythm of each other\u2019s breath."
  - "Your head leans on his shoulder. His body feels both warm and familiar.\n\nThe
    moon is full, the town distant, and it feels like you\u2019re the only two people
    in the entire world."
  - Without a word, Armand leans in towards you, his eyes closed.
  - 'Your lips meet his and a joyful shiver runs through your body. His hand comes
    up to stroke the side of your face as his other arm hugs you close. '
  - 'You gently pull away and place a finger on his lips. He opens his eyes and blushes.


    "Of course, we could keep enjoying the view, for a little while longer..."'
  - He uses his sleeve to sweep the snow off the wide piece of stone, then gestures
    out towards the lake your town is built on the edge of. "Our new bench may not
    be the most prestigious real estate, but the view is quite nice, and the company's
    the best in the world."
  - "You sit on your newfound bench with Armand, your bodies close together for warmth.
    Side by side, you stare out at the lake. Its water is so still that it almost
    seems like a mirror, the luminous reflection of the full moon is only lightly
    obscured the by occasional passing motes of fog dancing across the lake\u2019s
    surface."
  - "\u201CYvette, I-\u201D Armand starts, but stops. His talent for words seems to
    have failed him. Instead, he leans in towards you, his eyes closed."
  - "You\u2019re not sure how long your kiss lasts, time seems to have lost some of
    its importance. "
  - 'You pull away from each other, and you stare into his eyes. His face is a mixture
    of excitement and surprise. He whispers to you "I hope every kiss we have is as
    good as that one."


    Armand breathes deep, preparing himself for his next words.'
  - "It\u2019s then that a man stumbles out of the darkness towards you, glancing
    about himself, and trying to catch his breath."
  - "Your town is relatively small, and yet you still don\u2019t recognize this man. "
  - "Eyes widening for a moment, he seems to notice you for the first time. \u201CI...
    am Charles, a good friend of Monsieur Armand,\u201D he states, slowly and carefully.
    \u201CI was afraid he\u2019d already left for the Estates General.\u201D "
  - "Charles places a small leather case in Armand\u2019s hands. \u201CI just wanted
    to make sure that he didn\u2019t forget these documents. It\u2019s quite fortunate
    that I found him in time.\u201D"
  - "\u201CCharles\u2026 what a surprise,\u201D Armand starts, his voice flat and
    tense."
  - "He pulls you closer and stares out at the lake. \u201CI know I\u2019m doing the
    right thing for France by going, but I\u2019m going to miss moments like this,\u201D
    he sighs.\n\nArmand breathes deep, preparing himself for his next words."
  - "\u201CAnd who might you be, madame?\u201D"
  - "Charles winces as if he\u2019d been cut. \u201CI\u2019m so sorry madame, that
    was very rude of me. It\u2019s a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.\u201D "
  - "Charles regards you warily as he continues. \u201CArmand, I\u2019ll keep this
    short. We all knew tensions were going to keep rising after the riots in Grenoble,
    but it\u2019s happening faster than any of us would have ever imagined.\u201D "
  - "He looks back and forth between the two of you and gives a quick, formal bow.
    \u201CYou two are obviously in the middle of something important. Please excuse
    my intrusion. <i>Bonne nuit</i>.\u201D"
  - With that, Charles leaves. You and Armand stare at each other, silently, for over
    a minute.
  - "Armand exhales and smiles, but there\u2019s still an air of tension about him.
    \u201CNot right now, no. It\u2019s all\u2026 very vague at the moment. There\u2019s
    so much going on that I don\u2019t want to give you something new to worry about.\u201D"
  - "\"That\u2026 was Charles.\" Armand says evenly. \"I used to buy books from him
    by letter. However, a few months ago we started a true correspondance between
    myself and some of his associates. We've been discussing politics.\""
  - "\u201CWe share a lot of ideas in common.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThe Estates General might be the last chance to keep this country on the
    proper course, which means we can take absolutely no chances.\u201D Charles glances
    significantly to the package now in Armand\u2019s hands. \"You know who to contact
    when you arrive in Paris, they'll lead you to Johanna.\""
  - Charles looks back and forth between the two of you and gives a slow, formal bow.
    "Please excuse my intrusion. <i>Bonne nuit</i>."
  - "\u201CArmand, things are changing faster than we could have imagined,\u201D the
    man called Charles says, hurriedly pressing a small satchel into Armand\u2019s
    hands. In the dim light you manage to notice the a few papers sticking out of
    the top of the bag. \u201CWe all knew tensions were going to keep rising after
    Bishop Bonteville killed himself, but this-\u201D"
  - "\u201CCharles\u2026\u201D Armand presses at a louder volume, glancing towards
    you."
  - "\u201CArmand, I know this is hard, but France itself is at stake here.\u201D
    Charles continues, oblivious to your presence. \u201CWe helped guarantee your
    election for our <i>Bailliage</i>, so you could do this for us. You said it yourself
    \u2018We must-\u201D"
  - "\u201CCharles!\u201D Armand barks sharply and suddenly. Even the crickets and
    the birds seem to go silent."
  - "Breathing deeply, Armand recomposes himself, and gestures in your direction.
    \u201CCharles, have you met my fiance Yvette Decaux? We were just enjoying our
    last night together before I left to prepare for the Estates General.\u201D"
  - "Charles\u2019 eyes widen and he seemingly notices you for the first time. \u201COh\u2026
    hello Madame. I was just giving your fiance some important files that he forgot
    at home. Please excuse my intrusion. <i>Bonne nuit</i>.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIdeas about modernity, monarchy, and what France needs in order to succeed
    in a changing world.\u201D Armand says, almost automatically, before looking away
    from you and blushing for a moment. His breath mists in the air, as he stares
    out across the still waters of the lake."
  - "Armand looks away, staring out across the lake. \u201CIt\u2019s something\u2026
    something that I cannot tell you about. Not yet.\u201D"
  - "\u201CStill, thank you. It makes me glad to know I still have you on my side.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI promise that I\u2019ll explain all of this when it\u2019s over.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI know that isn\u2019t the whole answer, or what you want to hear. However,
    I need you to trust me Yvette, please.\u201D\n\nHis voice is serious. Grave. Pained."
  - '"France is changing, that cannot be stopped. It''s up to us to make sure that
    it changes for the better."'

  - (You have gained a little favor with Armand)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Armand)
  - (You have gained some favor with Armand)
  - (You have gained some favor with Armand)
  - "Your fiance is trying to look positive, but his expression falters slightly in
    the face of Charles\x19s grave expression and warning. "
  - "He waves to the barmaid, who brings you a bottle of wine and some glasses, along
    with a loaf of freshly baked bread that\x19's still steaming when it touches the
    table. "
  - "He waves to barmaid, who brings you a bottle of wine and some glasses, along
    with a loaf of freshly baked bread that\x19s still steaming when it touches the
    table. "
  - "\"\x1CArmand, I\x19've been looking everywhere for you!\x1D\" He whispers hoarsely.
    His accent is foreign, and wholly unfamiliar. All you know is that he isn't French,
    nor is he English."
