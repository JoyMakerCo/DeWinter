  - You wake up to find a letter waiting for you on your bedside table. This wouldn't
    be unusual, save for the fact that it's sealed in plain uncolored wax, which
    hasn't been stamped with a sigil of any sort.
  - Opening the letter, you immediately recognize Armand's handwriting. However,
    the writing style is remarkably brief for him, and you find yourself instinctively
    checking for another three or four pages of text that don't exist.
  - "'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette,\n\nJohanna recently finished setting up a meeting place
    where we can meet with notable individuals who are attending the Estates General.
    More importantly, these are persons who are interested in learning more about
    the goals of our humble society.'"
  - It sounds to you like some very influential people are genuinely intrigued by
    this Frankish Hapsburgian Society business. You read on a little further and
    find an address. It looks like these events aren't happening very far from your
    home.
  - '''Your knowledge, canniness and infamy would be an amazing asset to us. I would
    love to see you there.'''
  - "'<i>Je t'embrasse</i>,\r\n\r\nArmand\x19\r'"
  - You put down the letter, and check your calendar. You might be able to visit
    that place today, if you like.
  - ('Foreign Entanglements' is now available for you to visit on the Paris map)
  - Opening the letter, you immediately recognize Armand's handwriting. However,
    the writing style is remarkably brief for him, and you find yourself instinctively
    checking for another three or four pages of text that don't exist.
  - You read the plans detailed within the letter, and your heart sinks when you
    realize that he must have sent message this before he was imprisoned for treason.
  - You put down the letter, and shake your head. There's nothing to do, but move
    on.
