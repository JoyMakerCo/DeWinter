  - 'The next few moments are a blur. '
  - "The watchman grabs you by the wrist, his calloused hand feels like a vice. You
    pull back and scream in shock. Alarmed by the sound, more of the watchmen\u2019s
    compatriots appear. "
  - "Accusations are shouted. A sergeant with breath that stinks of cheap wine demands
    to know who you\u2019re working for, his fat fingers dangerously close to your
    face. Everything starts getting louder and more chaotic with every passing moment. "
  - The watchman grabs you by the wrist. Hansel grabs him by the throat. People start
    screaming. More watchmen appear. Everything starts getting louder and more chaotic
    with every passing moment.
  - "An hour later, you\u2019re sitting alone in a dark cell back at the Guet Royal\u2019s
    watch post. You\u2019re not sure what you\u2019ve been charged with, but this
    whole situation is obviously less than ideal. "
  - "You feel yourself being jostled in the sudden melee like a piece of flotsam
    in a turbulent river. You try to find an exit, a way to flee, but it\u2019s a
    struggle just to stay standing."
  - "An hour later, you\u2019re sitting alone in a dark cell back at the Guet Royal\u2019s
    watch post. You\u2019re not sure what you\u2019ve been charged with, but this
    is obviously less than ideal. "
  - "The hours blur together and you feel nothing, other than the truly stultifying
    boredom of being locked in a stone box by yourself. You bang at the cell door
    to ask what you\u2019ve been charged with. One of the watchmen says he\u2019ll
    go find out, but you never hear from him again. The others don\u2019t even bother
    to answer you."
  - Your malaise is suddenly interrupted by the distant sound of a commotion, followed
    by the enraged shouts of a familiar voice...
  - That night, while trying to sleep, you wake up to find the fattest rat you've
    ever seen crawling on your leg and trying to eat your shoes. With a few choice
    words and some shakes of your leg, you manage to shoo it away.
  - "The next morning, you are so bored that you've decided to name the rat. His
    name is Fran\xE7ois-Louis, and he is a successful restaurateur in the rat community.
    He hoped to serve your shoes to his patrons as a lavish delicacy."
  - Eventually, that morning, the door opens.
  - "\u201CAlright madame, you\u2019re free to go.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI mean, we can keep you here for longer, but we\u2019d have to start charging
    rent,\u201D the watchman replies with a shrug. \u201CWe looked into your background
    and it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re a known enemy of the crown. You were
    just trespassing, and it felt like a night in a cell was enough.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat were you charged with?\u201D the watchman asks, indignant at any
    attempt to question his authority. He scowls, and begins to stretch the limits
    of his imagination. \u201CWell, you were trespassing and\u2026\u201D "
  - "\u201C... and trespassing. We didn\u2019t find anything stolen, and you didn\u2019t
    really do anything else. So, you\u2019re free to go!\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat is the meaning of this? You\u2019re keeping a lost and vulnerable
    Christian woman in need of guidance, amongst this loathsome squalor? Have you
    no shame?\u201D"
  - "\u201CNo, I shall not be calm! In the name of Saint Nicholas of Myra, you will
    turn this lost soul over to my care! You will do this for the sake of her soul,
    and dare I say, for you own!\u201D"
  - The shouting continues for a little while longer until you hear the jingling
    of keys, and the creaking of the door being unlocked.
  - "\u201CHere she is, Father Sidotti,\u201D the watchman sighs. He looks like he
    just wants this entire ordeal to be over."
  - "\u201CHere she is, Father Sidotti,\u201D the watchman sighs. He looks like he
    just wants this entire ordeal to be over. \u201CHer associate is being held a
    few cells over, will you be needing that one too?\u201D "
  - "\u201CLeave us, my son,\u201D Ludovico commands, his voice steely and stern."
  - "With a weary nod, the watchman leaves the room and shuts the door behind himself.
    You don\u2019t hear the door lock."
  - "\u201CI have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect us to meet again under these circumstances.\u201D
    Ludovico says with a mischievous grin."
  - Ludovico smiles at your reply, and for a moment he looks you up and down in silence.
  - "\u201CIf by \u2018power\u2019, you mean \u2018the watchmen can\u2019t make me
    leave, and giving up a minor criminal is better than having me stand in their
    post loudly abjuring their immortal souls all day\u2019 then yes, I have that
    power.\u201D"
  - "\u201COne of my many duties in the city is visiting prisoners for confessionals.
    After all, those who\u2019ve fallen into wickedness are the ones who need our
    Lord\u2019s guidance the most.\u201D He gestures to the Bible in his hands. It\u2019s
    well cared for but also well worn, without any gilding or ornamentation. "
  - "\u201CYes, I will be collecting her hireling as well. Leave us, my son,\u201D
    Ludovico commands, his voice steely and stern. "
  - "With a weary nod, the watchman leaves the room and shuts the door behind himself.
    You don\u2019t hear the door lock."
  - "\u201CI have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect us to meet again under these circumstances.\u201D
    Ludovico says with a mischievous grin."
  - "\u201CWell, you see <i>signora</i>, I must admit that I\u2019ve never had to
    deal with a case as\u2026 interesting as your own. I think we\u2019d have to
    see each other quite a lot before I found some kind of solution.\u201D"
  - "\"But I would rather have this conversation somewhere less\u2026 dank and depressing.\"
    Ludovico says, already exiting the cell. \"This way, please.\""
  - "Outside, you breathe deeply, tasting fresh air for the first time in a while.
    It\u2019s a simply pleasure, but one you already missed. The city continues in
    its daily routine, as if nothing had even happened. "
  - "\u201CYour freedom, Yvette, has been delivered unto you.\u201D Ludovico pronounces,
    with a dramatic sweep of his hands, before continuing. \u201CWhile I would absolutely
    love to stay with you and help you celebrate it, I unfortunately have a lot more
    prisons to visit before the day is up.\u201D"
  - '"I find that the best way to deal with the powerful is to strike the perfect
    balance between ''helpful samaritan'' and ''irritating nuisance''. Neither a
    threat, nor something they want to have around for too long." He continues while
    examining your cell.'
  - "\"I could go on, but I would rather have this conversation somewhere less\u2026
    dank and depressing.\" Ludovico says, already exiting the cell. \"This way, please.\""
  - "\u201CI also find that knowing what the criminals are up to is a great way to
    understand what\u2019s really happening in a city.\u201D Ludovico admits with
    a shrug. \u201CThis allows my letters to Rome be a little more\u2026 complete.\u201D"
  - "He turns to you with a wry smile. \u201CNow imagine my surprise, when on my
    way to tend to the souls of thugs and cutpurses, I happen to see your name among
    the roll of prisoners.\u201D"
  - "\u201CObviously, you couldn\u2019t possibly be guilty of any crime, so I decided
    to intercede,\u201D he says with a wink."
  - "\u201CAnd yet with all of this knowledge, I\u2019m still hoping to know you
    better.\u201D "
  - "\"But please, I would rather have this conversation somewhere less\u2026 dank
    and depressing.\" Ludovico says, already exiting the cell. \"This way, please.\""
  - "\u201CI wouldn\u2019t say \u2018random chance\u2019. After all, the Lord works
    in mysterious ways.\u201D Ludovico replies with a shrug. "
  - "\u201CYour freedom, has been delivered unto you, Yvette.\u201D Ludovico pronounces,
    with a dramatic sweep of his hands."
  - "\u201CMay we meet again soon, under better circumstances.\u201D Ludovico says,
    with a slow and polite nod of his head. You reply with the appropriate curtsey."
  - Ludovico quickly disappears into the crowds, and you are left alone. A few gawkers
    note your bedraggled state and you can easily assume that the fact that you just
    spent a night in a jail cell is going to make it to all the right people.
  - You start the walk home, already relishing the idea of a hot meal, a long bath,
    and a fresh change of clothes.
  - "Ludovico turns to Hansel \u201CIt has also been delivered unto you\u2026 <i>Singore</i>...\u201D"
  - "\u201CMy name is Hansel, Father.\u201D Hansel replies gruffly. \u201CI am Madame
    Decaux\u2019s doorman.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHer doorman?\u201D Ludovico asks, his eyes resting on Hansel\u2019s recently
    returned sword."
  - "\u201C<i>Ja</i>. The city has many doors. Some of them are more dangerous than
    others. Madame Decaux pays me to make sure they\u2019re opened, or kept shut.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI see!\u201D Ludovico replies, clapping his hands together as if that
    just answered everything. \u201CWhile I would absolutely love to stay, I unfortunately
    have a lot more prisons to visit before the day is up.\""
  - Ludovico disappears into the crowds, leaving you and Hansel alone. A few gawkers
    note your bedraggled state and you can easily assume that the fact that you just
    spent a night in a jail cell is going to make it to all the right people. You
    start to walk and Hansel silently falls in step behind you.
  - "With neither a chastisement nor an apology, you\u2019re lead out onto the street,
    and the door of the watch post is slammed shut behind you. Just like that, you\u2019re
    free. "
  - A few gawkers note your bedraggled state and you can easily assume that the fact
    that you just spent a night in a jail cell is going to make it to all the right
    people.
  - You start the walk home, already relishing the idea of a hot meal, a long bath,
    and a fresh change of clothes
  - "Without so much as an apology, you\u2019re lead out onto the street, and the
    door of the watch post is slammed behind you. A few gawkers note your bedraggled
    state and you can easily assume that the fact that you just spent a night in
    a jail cell is going to make it to all the right people."
  - '(You have lost quite a bit of credibility)

    (You have lost some favor with
    everyone)'
  - '(You have lost quite a bit of credibility)

    (You have lost some favor with
    everyone, but Ludovico)'
  - The hours pass until morning. You feel nothing, other than the truly stultifying
    boredom of being locked in a stone box by yourself.
  - "You take some comfort in knowing that at least you\x19're not in prison anymore."
  - "\"May we meet again soon, under better circumstances.\x1D\" Ludovico says, with
    a slow and polite nod of his head. You reply with the appropriate curtsey. Hansel
    gives a grunt of appreciation."
  - Hansel has been placed in a separate cell, but you can hear him cursing to himself
    in German occasionally, so you know he's fine.
  - Somewhere else in the building, a pickpocket is screaming about his innocence.
    His alibi is getting more creative with every passing moment.
  - The obese thing squeaks indignantly at you before waddling away and squeezing
    through a hole in the wall.
  - "You can'\x19t wait to get out of here."
  - "It\x19s an impressive effort, with unimpressive results."
