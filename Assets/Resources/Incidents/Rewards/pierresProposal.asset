  - Pierre is staring at you. You must have gotten lost in your thoughts for a moment.
  - "\"Uh\u2026 Madame, I was asking \u2018How well do you know your fianc\xE9?\u2019\""
  - "\u201CEven after all of this anguish, you still feel this way towards him?\u201D
    Pierre asks, his shock barely concealed. \u201CSuch lasting affection, in this
    modern age, is quite rare.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWell Madame, I would say that in times of uncertainty, you should always
    seek the truth,\u201D Pierre replies quietly, leaning closer. \u201CThe truth
    may hurt you now, but lies will always hurt more later.\u201D"
  - "Pierre notes your confusion and for a moment, almost looks sympathetic \u201CWell
    madame, perhaps it\u2019s time that you learned as much as you can. Which is
    something I can certainly help with.\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou see, I\u2019m looking to run a new social piece, something that will
    capture the imagination of the public,\u201D Pierre favors you with a broad,
    toothy grin \u201CIt may also rekindle some old rivalries, so to speak. After
    all, it\u2019s easier to sell newspapers when there\u2019s something to write
    about.\u201D"
  - Pierre puffs out his chest, and strikes a heroic pose. "I shall do my best to
    reunite you with your lost Armand, as it has often been rightly said that I am
    a man dedicated to the causes of truth, and love!"
  - "You look Pierre up and down, not really certain if anybody has described him
    in that way\u2026 ever."
  - "\u201COf course, I cannot work for free.\u201D Pierre admits, shifting awkwardly
    from foot to foot. \u201CI must support my newspaper, after all. But if you help
    me with this, I will help you as best I can.\u201D"
  - "\u201COf course, I cannot work for free, as my esteemed newspaper comes first.
    However, I can still provide you with some good leads, in exchange for your help.\u201D"
  - '"If you bring me gossip related to the Crown, I''ll tell you where to learn
    more about your estranged Armand."'
  - '"Once you get me this gossip, my journalistic genius shall handle the rest."'
  - '"Now then, to business?"'
  - '"If you bring me gossip related to the Church, I''ll tell you where to learn
    more about your estranged Armand."'
  - '"If you bring me gossip related to the Military, I''ll tell you where to learn
    more about your estranged Armand."'
  - '"If you bring me gossip related to the Bourgeoisie, I''ll tell you where to
    learn more about your estranged Armand."'
  - '"If you bring me gossip related to the Revolution, I''ll tell you where to learn
    more about your estranged Armand."'

    the allotted time and you'll receive special rewards. You can track these requests
    in the Gossip tab of your Journal.)
