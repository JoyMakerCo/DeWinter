  _nodeText:
  - You start your morning by sitting straight up in bed, struck with a bolt of realization.
  - "You need Gabriel to prove that Maximin had an illegitimate child with Marguerite,
    and that he tried to destroy Marguerite\u2019s life over it. However, Marguerite
    won\u2019t let you do anything that might put Gabriel in harm\u2019s way, even
    if it lets her get justice on Maximin.\r"
  - "However, you don\u2019t need Gabriel, in person to do that. You just need something
    that the public would find convincing.\r\n\r\nWhat if you had a painting?"
  - This would, of course, have to be a great painting. It would need to perfectly
    show the resemblance between Gabriel and his absentee father. It would also have
    to be made by an established painter, someone whose abilities were unimpeachable.
  - "Racking your brain for such an artist, you keep coming back to the same name,
    one that you learned quite recently. \r"
  - "\xC9lisabeth Le Brun."
  - "\xC9lisabeth\u2019s well-known as an accomplished portrait painter, having even
    painted Queen Marie Antoinette herself. In fact, she was trusted to paint a picture
    of the Queen with her children."
  - "If you reach out to \xC9lisabeth, you might be able to commission a painting
    of Marguerite and Gabriel. This would add an enormous air of credibility to any
    accusations you lay at Maximin\u2019s feet."
  - Racking your brain for such an artist, you keep coming back to the same name.
    A name that you've heard, whispered over and over again, in the halls of parties
    and salons.
  - "Madame Le Brun\u2019s well-known as an accomplished portrait painter, having
    even painted Queen Marie Antoinette herself. In fact, she was trusted to paint
    a picture of the Queen with her children."
  - "You shuffle through your notes and you're pretty certain you know where her
    studio is. If you go there, you might be able to commission a painting of Marguerite
    and Gabriel. This would add an enormous air of credibility to any accusations
    you lay at Maximin\u2019s feet."
  - ('Commissioning Vengeance' is now available to visit on the Paris Map)
  - You could reach out to her today, if you liked.
