        eyes and relax, just focusing on listening to the whole bustling cafe. Not
        focusing on one individual conversation, but just letting the sum total of
        the room flow into your ears, and then assessing it all together. Occasionally,
        you open your eyes to jot down a quick note.\r"

        Apparently, due to skipped wages, soldiers have become notoriously delinquent
        on their debts, and some have even reacted violently when asked to pay. This
        has led to some shop owners refusing to do business with soldiers at all.
        \n\nNobody's certain if that's right, or even legal."

        Nationalists are objecting to the Catholic Church being the only member of
        the first estate, as not all French citizens are Catholic. The believes they're
        justified because the offiical state religion of France is Catholocism.

  - "Taking out your journal and a pencil, you close your eyes and relax, just listening
    to the bustling caf\xE9. Not focusing on one individual, but letting the sum
    total of the room flow into your ears, and assessing it all together. Occasionally,
    you open your eyes to jot down notes.\r"
  - "After a few minutes, it becomes obvious that the Crown is significantly more
    powerful than the Revolution. While it might be possible for the Revolution to
    make the Crown give into their demands, they would have to build strong alliances
    with the other factions in order to do so. \r"
  - "You listen for what feels like an hour and you still can\u2019t draw a solid
    conclusion. The Crown and the Revolution are so evenly matched that you can\u2019t
    determine which would prevail in any sort of conflict. The victor would most
    certainly be determined by the strength of their alliances.\r"
  - "Opening your eyes, you switch your focus to something more specific. You scan
    the room, looking at everyone's manner of dress and body language. You'\x19re
    looking for more subtle hints about where everyone'\x19s allegiances lie. More
    notes quickly scratched into your journal.\r"

  - "Having reasoned that the Church is the most powerful of the minor factions in
    Paris, you glance over your notes and instantly come to the conclusion that they\u2019ve
    put their entire support behind the King and the aristocracy."
  - "Quickly scanning over your meticulous notes, you\u2019re quite certain that
    the Church is the most powerful of all the minor factions in Paris. Additionally,
    it seems that they strongly support the Royal family."
  - "After some consideration, you deduce that the Church is the most powerful minor
    faction in Paris. They support the Crown for now, but it wouldn\u2019t take much
    to swing the balance."
  - While you can easily conclude that the Church is the most powerful minor faction
    in Paris, you have a hard time determining whether they support the Crown or
    the Revolution more. It seems that their allegiance is currently up for grabs
    by either party.

    Paris, you glance over your notes and instantly come to the conclusion that they\u2019ve
    put their entire support behind the Revolution and their nationalists."
  - "Having reasoned that the Military is the most powerful of the minor factions
    in Paris, you glance over your notes and instantly come to the conclusion that
    they\u2019ve put their entire support behind the King and the aristocracy."

    in Paris, you glance over your notes and instantly come to the conclusion that
    they\u2019ve put their entire support behind the King and the aristocracy."
  - "Quickly scanning over your meticulous notes, you\u2019re quite certain that

  - Now that you have your bearings, politically, you start becoming a little more
    involved with your fellow patrons.
  - "Frowning in irritation, you look down at your notes and realize that there\x19's
    no clear pattern in anything you'\x19ve seen. It seems like the minor factions
    of the city are nearly equal in power, and this jumble makes it difficult to
    discern any additional information about them."
  - 'Someone is reading loudly from a pamphlet extolling the virtues of the king
    as the surrogate father of the nation, but nobody''s really paying attention
    to him. '
  - A man in the corner keeps trying to use verses from the Bible to justify the
    Church's right to avoid taxation, but it's hard to hear him over the sound of
    jeering patrons.
  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Church and the Crown. Some aristocrats
    are angry that the first estate is allowed to send priests that weren't born
    in France as representatives to the Estates General.
  - A disheveled woman is banging her fist on her table, claiming that officials
    who fail to pay the army's wages on time are actually thieves.
  - A lawyer is trying to convince people that taxes should be reformed according
    to 'natural law', but nobody seems able to agree on what natural law is.
  - A young woman is flitting between tables, discreetly distributing revolutionary
    flyers. The owner is pretending not to see her do this.

  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Military and the Crown. Aristocratic
    officers are lobbying the king for the right to dress as they please at court,
    instead of wearing their uniforms. They feel that being forced to wear military
    livery casts them as servants, instead of leaders. The generals are obviously
    unhappy about this.

  - It's now late in the day, and while you're certain the conversations here will
    carry on long into the night, you feel like you've done what you came here to
    do. You say your goodbyes to the various patrons of the cafe and head home, with
    a little more knowledge than you had before.

    Nationalists want to move France towards a constitutional government, but monarchists
    claim that France is in too tumultuous a state for such a radical transition.

  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Military and the Bourgeoisie. Due
    to skipped wages, soldiers have become notoriously delinquent on their debts,
    and some have even reacted violently when asked to pay. This has led to some
    shop owners refusing to do business with soldiers at all. Nobody's certain if
    that's right, or even legal.

  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Revolution and the Church. Nationalists
    are objecting to the Catholic Church being the only member of the first estate,
    as not all French citizens are Catholic. The believes they're justified because
    the official state religion of France is Catholocism.

  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Military and the Church. Given the
    rising tensions, patriotic citizens are questioning the loyalties of French priests.
    The Catholic Church is a foreign government with its own laws. More pious folk
