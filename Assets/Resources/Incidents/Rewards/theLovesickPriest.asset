  - You reach out and knock on the door of the carriage. The silhouetted figure jumps
    in surprise.
  - "An accented voice calls out to you. \u201CUh\u2026 who is it?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh my!\u201D the voice behind the door calls out. After some fumbling,
    he parts the curtains on the carriage windows."
  - "Behind the door you hear a sputter of barely suppressed laughter.\r\n\r\nHe
    opens the door.\r"
  - "\u201CHello Madame Decaux! Do not worry, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something
    I can do for you.\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Buonasera</i> Castigated Woman. I am Father Sidotti. It\u2019s a pleasure
    to make your acquaintance.\u201D"
  - '"How may I help you?"'
  - "For the first time today, you see someone look at you with genuine concern.
    \u201CHow terrible! Please, come aboard, it\u2019s no trouble at all.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    puts down his book and waves you inside.\r"
  - "A smile flashes across his lips before he glances away.\r \u201C\u2018Ask, and
    it shall be given you\u2019. I\u2019m sure we can make a stop.\u201D Father Sidotti
    steps down from the carriage and offers you his hand. He helps you inside."
  - "The inside of the carriage is very similar to the outside. It\u2019s simple,
    but lovingly crafted. Father Sidotti sits across from you, his eyes darting between
    you and the small stack of books on the seat next to him.\r\n\r\nHe signals the
    coachman by tapping the ceiling of the carriage, and you head off towards Paris.\r"
  - "He stares at you for a while and almost starts talking, before thinking better
    of it. This process repeats a few more times, before he finally speaks.\r"
  - "\u201CMay I ask what happened?\u201D"
  - "With a slight smile he exhales, looking less tense than before.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019m
    glad to see that you\u2019re taking this setback in good humor. Not everyone
    would be so unflustered by such a turn of events.\u201D \r"
  - "He raises his eyebrows. \u201CWhat a worrying turn of events. A missing fianc\xE9,
    sudden enemies, and now a missing carriage. It sounds like you\u2019ve been beset
    by quite the number of misfortunes.\u201D\r"
  - "The young priest laughs loudly.\r\n\r\n\u201CI must be very fortunate, to have
    a martyr in my presence. I\u2019m glad to see you made it without any extra holes
    in you.\u201D\r"
  - "You\u2019re not so sure if you actually feel unflustered, but it\u2019s good
    that you can project it. \r"
  - "\u201CWhile I wasn\u2019t present for it, I heard about what our host put you
    through. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to endure such a dreadful humiliation.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m guessing then that you must be the one I\u2019ve heard about.
    I\u2019m sorry that our host felt it acceptable to treat you so poorly.\u201D"
  - "After a few more giggles, his face turns more serious. \u201CI heard that you
    were searching for your fianc\xE9, and that our host thought it would be good
    sport to ridicule you in front of their friends. Utterly barbaric.\u201D He follows
    this up by muttering something decidedly unchristian to himself in Italian."
  - "\u201CAre you... alright?\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re right. I was born and raised in Rome. My family\u2019s about
    as traditional as it comes, so when my parents had three sons, they knew what
    to do with us immediately. One man of arms, one man of letters, and one\u2026\u201D
    he gestures broadly to himself, \u201Cman of the cloth.\u201D"
  - "\u201CResilience is good\u2026\u201D he replies trailing off for a moment. \u201CJust
    make sure to give yourself time to rest. Even the most minor of injuries can
    wear on the soul, if left uncared for.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI can certainly understand why.\u201D Father Sidotti replies. He gestures,
    not at you, but at your situation in general. \u201CI hope, at least, that I\u2019ve
    managed to make things a little more bearable.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThe seminary wasn\u2019t bad, it was the first time in my life that people
    were happy that I spent all of my time reading. I was ordained a few years ago
    and shuffled around to help with various parishes in Rome. All the older priests
    liked me because I didn\u2019t talk too much.\u201D"
  - "He blushes for a moment and stares out the window \u201CThough, that made holding
    mass a little difficult for me. A lot of awkward silences.\u201D"
  - "\u201CA few months ago, I was pulled aside and told that I would be sent to
    Paris. There\u2019s been a lot of\u2026 unrest here. My superiors in Rome wanted
    an outside opinion.\u201D He pauses for a moment to fiddle with his rosary.\r"
  - "\u201CYou see, sending a bishop or a cardinal here, with all their retinue,
    would arouse too much suspicion. It\u2019d make people think something bad was
    going to happen. A single priest? Nobody notices that.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CSorry, I didn\u2019t mean to bore you with my life story. I ramble when
    I\u2019m nervous.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CReally?\u201D he coughs awkwardly and looks away. \u201CYou are too kind,
    madame.\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CWould you believe that it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve shared my carriage
    with an enchanting woman?\u201D"
  - "He shrugs. \u201CWell, at least we\u2019re on equal footing.\u201D"
  - "A flush of color darkens the young priest\u2019s cheeks. \u201CWhile I appreciate
    the offer, please don\u2019t feel obligated to make enemies just for my sake.
    I might not always be around to save you.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CBut what about you? Are you alright?\u201D"
  - "\u201CHow are you feeling, right now?\u201D"
  - "Eventually the conversation dies down, the adrenaline rush of the night\u2019s
    disasters and indignities giving way to simple exhaustion. Father Sidotti settles
    into his books, and you occupy yourself with watching the scenery go by, and
    trying not to fall asleep.\r"
  - "The conversation continues apace for the rest of the carriage ride. Most of
    your free time growing up was spent reading, and ignoring your parents, so you
    both seem to have a lot in common. When this evening started, you didn\u2019t
    expect to find yourself in a carriage, discussing Voltaire and Goethe with a
    Catholic Priest.\r"
  - "The carriage stops and the coachman opens the door. As you step down into the
    street, Father Sidotti leans out of the carriage to look at your home. \r\n\r\n\u201CAh,
    I see you have chosen to live humbly. It\u2019s good for the soul.\u201D He muses
    aloud.\r"
  - "\u201CUntil we meet again, madame!\u201D He calls cheerily before the carriage
    drives off into the night. \rYou realize that Camille is already waiting for
    you at the door.\r"
  - "\u201CWho was that?\u201D she asks."
  - You step inside and head upstairs, your mind still reeling from the day's events.
    Slowly, you get undressed and open your journal to record exactly what transpired
    tonight.
  - Your mind brimming with new possibilities, you step inside and head upstairs.
    Slowly, you get undressed and open your journal to record exactly what transpired
    tonight.
  - 'The carriage rolls to a stop, cutting him off mid-sentence. You hear the crunch
    of hobnailed boots on cobblestones as the coachman walks to the door, but Father
    Sidotti opens it first. He steps down and offers you his hand.


    "This has
    been a rare pleasure madame," he says as you step into the street.'
  - "\u201CHopefully, we\u2019ll meet again under better circumstances.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CPlease, call me Ludovico.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHeaven help you, if you do,\u201D he chuckles, \u201CAnd please madame,
    call me Ludovico.\u201D\r"
  - You turn to your home find that Camille is already there, holding the door open
    for you.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained some favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained some favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - "(You have gained some favor with Ludovico)\r"
  - With a nod, Ludovico steps into his carriage, and disappears into the night.
