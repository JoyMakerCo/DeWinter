        night, you were celebrating some of his increased influence among the revolutionaries,
        but you also noticed that he was taking intermittent sips from a small bottle
        of liquor. He's obviously had quite a bit to drink today.

  _nodeText:
  - After the rendezvous, Antoine offers to walk you home. Early on in the night,
    you were celebrating some of his increased influence among the revolutionaries,
    but you also noticed that he was taking intermittent sips from a small bottle
    of liquor. He's obviously had quite a bit to drink today.
  - Actually, now that you think about it, you've noticed that Antoine rarely drinks
    at all. Something is bothering him, and his normal fiery responses are few and
    far between.
  - A few minutes later, your conversation reaches a long, silent lull.
  - He starts, as if he didn't realize that you were talking to him. "Hmph! I drifted
    off didn't I?" He replies.
  - You stay silent, but upbeat. You hold his hand, and try to create space for him
    to speak his mind. While he doesn't say anything immediately, you can tell that
    he appreciates the effort you put forward.
  - '"How and why I pollute my body is my business." He snaps at you.'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - He sighs. "I'm sorry, you haven't done anything wrong. I'm just thinking about
    the past."
  - "\"Back in <i>Bl\xE9rancourt</i>, I was seeing someone else. Her name was Th\xE9r\xE8se.\""
  - '"This morning, I started thinking about the past, and I think my mind''s been
    going in circles ever since." He nods, starting to open up.'
  - '"We were nineteen, and in love. Her father was most powerful man in town, and
    didn''t approve of her daughter seeing a young playwright with a penchant for
    causing trouble." '
  - '"Still, we were inseparable. After a little while, I proposed to her, and she
    went to ask her father for permission. She was so excited."'
  - "\"There was some family business that needed to be taken care of, so I was abroad
    for a little while. Every day, I dreamed of coming home. I ran through every
    scenario in my head. I thought of marrying Th\xE9r\xE8se right away. I thought
    of how I'd have to convince her father to let her follow her heart. I thought
    of us having to steal away together in the middle of the night.\""
  - "\"By the time I got back, Th\xE9r\xE8se was already married to someone else,
    Emmanuel Thorin. Emmanuel was from an important family in town. Th\xE9r\xE8se's
    father didn't just overrule her wishes, he used her like a bargaining chip.\""
  - '"Nobody bothered to step in on her behalf, not even my own family." He growls
    through his teeth.'
  - "\"Agreed. I certainly screamed as much at them when I found out.\" He snorts
    derisively at the memory. \"If anger was fire, I would have burned all of <i>Bl\xE9rancourt</i>
    to cinders.\""
  - '"That''s the cowardice I''m talking about." He snarls. "They didn''t even try!
    They just let yet another important man have his way with other people''s lives."'
  - '"When I went to see her, she was distant and evasive. I think she felt too guilty
    to even speak to me properly."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - '"Of course, I was insensate with rage. So, I did what any full blooded man in
    my situation would do."'
  - '"I stole my family''s silver, a pair of pistols, and rode for Paris."'
  - '"So excited." He says again, taking a swig from the small bottle of liquor he''s
    been nursing throughout the night. '
  - '"When I came home, I was greeted by something else entirely."'
  - '"It was a good life for a few days before I was arrested." He says wistfully.
    "The kind of freedom I needed to clear my head. To align my principles."'
  - '"While I was locked in a reformatory, I had a lot of time to think about what,
    exactly, made me so angry."'
  - '"It wasn''t just my romances being foiled, or someone I loved being hurt, it
    was the thought that this was happening all over France. That it''s still happening
    every single day." '
  - '"Why are we so content to dine on the table scraps of powerful, selfish men?
    Why are we so content to let them carve up our lives?"'
  - '"Of course, I never blamed her. I know how much it must have hurt, which only
    made my anger worse."'
  - He pauses for a while, searching his memories. "It's funny. You're the first
    person I've told this story to, who cared about how she felt."
  - After taking a moment to regain his calm, Antoine turns to you and says, "Did
    you know some of our fellow revolutionaries heard about our direct action with
    the posters? They called it inspiring."
  - '"In fact, those same people have placed me in charge of secretly reaching out
    to some of the other causes in the city, to build alliances on behalf of the
    Revolution."'
  - '"Of course, while I understand the value of forming alliances, I also find the
    whole affair distasteful. I can''t bring myself to begin the kinds of intrigues
    that have turned the King''s courts into a festering pit of petty schemes."'
  - '"What do you think? Who should we reach out to?"'
  - He looks at you askance. "The Church? You really think I should reach out to
    those agents of a foreign monarch, who support the king, and strut about like
    petty nobles?"
  - He looks at you askance. "The Military? You really think I should reach out to
    the King's personal attack dogs?"
  - He looks at you askance. "The Bourgeoisie? You really think I should reach out
    to those money-hungry pigs?"
  - After a long pause, he rubs his chin thoughtfully. "Perhaps, you're right. While
    the priests in the cities are self centered and corrupt, the ones in the country-side
    might care about our cause. They're also experienced in rousing the common people
    to action."
  - He rubs his chin thoughtfully. "Perhaps, you're right. Most of their ranks are
    made of desperate common men, and they're a group founded in stern discipline.
    We'd just need to convince them to fight for a righteous cause, instead of a
    tyrannical one."
  - He rubs his chin thoughtfully. "Perhaps, you're right. In the end, they're common
    people just like us, and their clout would be useful."
  - (The Bourgoeisie have moved towards the Revolution by a decent amount)
  - (The Military has moved towards the Revolution by a decent amount)
  - (The Church has moved towards the Revolution by a decent amount)
  - You talk for a little bit longer, until the two of you arrive at your house.
    As always, Camille is waiting for you on your doorstep. "<i>Bonsoir Madame!</i>"
  - '"Oh, and who is this?" Antoine asks.'
  - '"Monsieur, I am Camille, Madame Decaux''s maid-of-all-works." Camille replies
    cheerily.'
  - '"What do you think of her, as your servant?" Antoine whispers to you.'
  - '"I''m glad to hear that. I always like to know that someone appreciates the
    people that do so much for them."'
  - '"That''s a pity." Antoine replies with a stony expression. "I assumed you''d
    be more appreciative of someone who does so much for you."'
  - '"My family used to keep several, in fact. However, I''ve abandoned the practice.
    I can''t fight for liberty while asking someone else to make my bed. Though,
    I must admit that Camille is quite charming, in her own way." '
  - '"I''ve never blown glass, I''ve never laid bricks, I''ve never made a boat..."
    Camille continues to list off tasks she''s never done in your service.'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - '"I''ve never blown glass, I''ve never laid bricks, I''ve never made a boat..."
    Camille continues to list off tasks she''s never done in your service.'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Antoine)
  - '"I''ve never blown glass, I''ve never laid bricks, I''ve never made a boat..."
    Camille continues to list off tasks she''s never done in your service.'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - '"<i>Bonne nuit, mesdames.</i>" Antoine says with an upwards nod, and walks away
    into the night.'
  - '"He seems nice."'
  - You head upstairs to your room, your mind swirling the with night's revelations.
    You wonder if Antoine could have been different, or if he was always fated to
