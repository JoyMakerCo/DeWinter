  - "Out of the corner of your eye, you notice a tall, thin man dressed in somber,
    serious colors. The way people are clustered around him, you get the feeling that
    he\u2019s quite important. He glances up from his current conversation, politely
    excuses himself, and approaches you.\r"
  - "\u201CBut please, let us dispense with titles, you may call me Maximin!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    crowd chuckles, and you can\u2019t help but be surprised by this noble\u2019s
    informality. This would be downright scandalous in any other circle. The conversations
    in the various corners of the room die down as people strain to hear your exchange
    with Maximin.\r"
  - "\u201CIt\u2019s great to meet the woman Armand spoke so much of. He said more
    about you than he did the state of the nation, and you know much he loves that.\u201D
    Maximin smiles and offers a knowing wink. \u201CNow that I\u2019ve seen you, I
    can see why he had such muddled priorities.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIn fact, you may both find these useful!\u201D He grabs a jumbled stack
    of political pamphlets off of his desk and hands them to you. \u201CDiscourse
    moves so rapidly after all, and I would hate for the two of you to have any trouble
    keeping up.\u201D\r\n\nA few voices in the crowd murmur in approval.\r"
  - "Maximin pauses, his eyes sweeping the room for a moment. \u201CBut please, I
    must trouble you with a question of my own.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CThat\u2019s fantastic to hear! I\u2019m surprised that Armand thinks so
    highly of true, revolutionary minds.\u201D Murmurs of appreciation and agreement
    ripple through the crowd, but are quickly hushed by other guests, who are also
    pretending that they\u2019re not listening in.\r"
  - "Maximin chuckles, \u201COf course, this gathering is more of a salon than a party,
    but I can see why you would be confused.\u201D He reaches out and pats your hand.
    \u201CPlease don\u2019t be embarrassed, I\u2019m sure Armand will be able to explain
    the differences later, when he\u2019s feeling better.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIn fact, when you do that, I have a message for him. Write this down, if
    you can.\u201D"
  - "The crowd is no longer making a secret of observing your conversation. They\u2019re
    gawking. \r"
  - "With a flood of realization he laughs \u201COh, but of course! You\u2019re just
    here, at my salon, to find your Armand! I thought you were here for our enlightened
    discourse but\u2026 no, this makes much more sense.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIf he\u2019s lost then it means we no longer have to entertain his invalid
    opinions.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI invited your dullard fiance in order to denounce him and his views. People
    as uninformed as himself should not waste their time clouding discussions with
    their tiresome ignorance. They\u2019re better served by repeating the words of
    their more revolutionary peers.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI do not know where he has skulked off to, nor am I inclined to find him.\u201D"
  - "You hear a collective intake of breath from the gawking crowd. Maximin seems
    on the verge of a retort, but he stutters for a moment instead.\r"
  - "Maximin narrows his eyes until they\u2019re barely more than slits. \u201CIn
    fact, you can practice this virtue now and make sure that he hears this, should
    you manage to find him.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CCalls for moderation in our time of crisis can only be seen as treasonous
    to the people of France. He is an enemy of the revolution, an enemy of the common
    people of France, and an enemy of mine. The only thing he can do to atone for
    his miserable views is to take you, and return to the backwards obscurity from
    whence he came!\u201D\r"
  - "Maximin\u2019s voice drops low, to a growl barely above a whisper, \u201CBefore
    you speak, I already know what you\u2019re thinking. That somehow, you don\u2019t
    deserve this\u2026\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CThe only reason I even invited him was to save myself the time of authoring
    a pamphlet denouncing him.\u201D Maximin snorts \u201CHe, and his regressive calls
    for moderation and discussion. In a time of such turmoil in our country, only
    decisive action has any meaning. To believe otherwise is to be a coward, and a
    bootlick to the enemies of the people.\u201D"
  - "\u201CAnd you\u2026\u201D he continues \u201CI don\u2019t need to investigate
    you any further to know that you are cut from the same wretched cloth.\u201D \r\n\r\r\nThe
    room is quiet enough to hear a pin drop.\r"
  - "The Baron takes a breath to recompose himself and snort derisively. \u201CWell
    actually, if you\u2019d taken the time to read any of the materials I just gave
    you, then you\u2019d know that calls for civility are the enemy of progress.\u201D
    \r"
  - "He takes a step towards you, and you can see that his eyes are filled with hate.
    \u201CNow still your childish tongue. The adults are talking.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou are wrong.\u201D \r"
  - "\u201COur associations reflect our character, and you have chosen to associate
    yourself with an ignorant boor who drags at the heels of true progress in France.
    I can only assume that you are a craven opportunist who thought that marrying
    into a title would provide an easy path above her peers. That your life would
    be easy, if you just found the right person to latch onto.\u201D "
  - "\u201CLike a barnacle... or a leech.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou are a fool for believing that, and he is a fool for loving you.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CTitles don\u2019t elevate us above consequences. Now, leave my house and
    never return.\u201D"
  - "\u201CAh, you must be Madame Decaux! I\u2019m not sure if Armand spoke of me,
    I am Baron Maximin de Termes.\u201D Right as he focuses his attention on you,
    you can feel everyone in the room watching you out of the corners of their eyes.
    His opinion must carry a great deal of weight."
  - "\u201CI\u2019ve been told that Armand is unable to join us tonight. What has
    delayed him?\u201D"
  - "\"\x1COh, really?\""
  - "\u201CYou\u2019ve lost him?\u201D Maximin asks, a sudden note of confusion marring
    his features. \u201CAnd you came here?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CTell your Baron de Marbo to stay in his sick bed. It is a blessing for
    all of France that we no longer have to deal with his ignorant and uninformed
    declarations.\u201D He emphasizes his point by slapping one of his pamphlets against
    his thigh. \u201CWho knows? Perhaps if the two of you read enough, you might be
    able to stop embarrassing yourselves.\u201D\r"
  - "\"I must say that I\u2019m surprised that Armand thinks so highly of true, revolutionary
    minds.\u201D Murmurs of appreciation and agreement ripple through the crowd, but
    are quickly hushed by other guests, who are also pretending that they\u2019re
    not listening in.\r"
  - "Maximin chuckles, \u201COf course, this gathering is more of a salon than a party,
    but I can see why you would be confused.\u201D He reaches out and pats your hand.
    \u201CPlease don\u2019t be embarrassed, I\u2019m sure Armand will be able to explain
    the differences later, when he\u2019s feeling better.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CUnless, of course, he\u2019s not actually sick.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIt\u2019s been weeks since anyone\u2019s heard from the Baron de Marbo.
    Originally, I\u2019d taken it as a blessing that we no longer had to deal with
    his ignorant and uninformed declarations. However, now I find myself face to face
    with his fiancee, who isn\u2019t just ignorant, but a liar!\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYour loyalty to Armand is commendable, and exactly the sort of thing we\u2019re
    striving to bring to this troubled nation of ours.\u201D\r\n\r\nA small cheer
    goes up from some of the crowd.\r"
  - "\u201COf course, it\u2019s a shame your loyalty is anchored to such mediocrity,
    but still...\u201D"
  - "\u201CYour cowardly fiance could have spent his time doing something useful,
    like echoing the views of his betters. Instead he chose to waste our time with
    calls to consider lesser, erroneous perspectives. We don\u2019t need to tolerate
    this kind of intellectual and moral weakness. Both of you should do the right
    thing and skulk back to wherever you came from, in silence.\u201D"
