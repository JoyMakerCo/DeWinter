  - You wake up to find a letter waiting for you on your bedside table, which wouldn't
    be unusual save for the fact that it's sealed in plain, uncolored wax, which hasn't
    been stamped with a sigil of any sort.
  - Opening the letter, you immediately recognize Armand's handwriting. However, the
    writing style is remarkably brief for him, and you find yourself instinctively
    checking for another three or four pages of text that don't exist.
  - "'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette,\n\nJohanna recently finished setting up a meeting place
    where we can meet with notable individuals who are attending the Estates General.
    More importantly, these are persons who are interested in learning more about
    the goals of our humble society.'"
  - It sounds to you like some very influential people sound genuinely intrigued by
    this Frankish Hapsburgian Society business. You read on a little further and find
    an address. It looks like these events aren't happening very far from your home.
  - '''Your knowledge, cannyness and infamy would be an amazing asset to us. I would
    love to see you there.'''
  - "'<i>Je t'embrasse</i>,\r\n\r\nArmand\x19\r'"
  - You put down the letter, and check your calendar. You might be able to visit that
    place today.
  - (Foreign Entanglements is now available for you to visit on the Paris map)
