  - You decide to investigate the vestibule after you notice guests starting to crowd
    the room. Amidst the general frantic energy, you manage to hear that the Comte
    de Sanson is about to reveal his son's fiance to the assembled crowd. Apparently,
    she's arriving any second!
  - "Of course, you know that no such woman actually eixsts. This is is all part of
    a plan divised by Monsieur Guillaume de Sabl\xE9, which will help you discredit
    the the Comte de Sanon, and thus your hated enemy Viscountess Marcelle de Foix."
  - "As you join the crowd, Guillaume steps up next to you and waggles his eyebrows
    at you. You can tell that he's barely concealing his excitement at to whatever
    is going to come , Guillaume tells you that the Comte de Sanson is about to reveal
    his son\u2019s bride (who does not exist) and that now is the time to strike! "
  - "Of course, you know that no such woman actually eixsts. This is is all part of
    a plan divised by Monsieur Guillaume de Sabl\xE9 which will help you discredit
    the the Comte de Sanon, and thus your hated enemy Baron Maximin de Termes."
  - '"The Comte de Sanson and his son have taken my bait. I''ve convinced them that
    their mysterious woman will soon be arriving by carriage to make her grand entrance.
    Oh, they''ll be so disappointed to find it empty, and the whole thing a ruse,
    won''t they?"'
  - '"This will, of course make the Crown look like utter buffoons, and I''m sure
    those assocatied with the Revolution will truly appreciate how you helped make
    this come to pass."'
  - '"This will, of course make the Revolution look like utter buffoons, and I''m
    sure those assocatied with the Crown will truly appreciate how you helped make
    this come to pass."'
  - You feel a surge of people in the crowd at the back of the vestibule and soon
    find yourself buoyed along by the movement of the other guests, until you find
    yourself outside.
  - Anticipation builds, as a splendid carriage approaches.
  - Unable to allow this plan to come to fruitition, you stealthily approach the Comte
    de Sanson and whisper a warning in his ear.
  - You set your jaw to prevent yourself from smiling too early, as that might give
    away the game, so to speak. Somehow, you and Guillaume manage to find yourself
    next to the Comte de Sanson, near the front of the crowd.
  - As fascinating and eventful as this all is, you use this opportunity to slip back
    inside before anyone takes any notice of you and starts to link you to these proceedings.
  - '"Now, I know much has been made of the mysterious woman who wishes to marry my
    son, Albert." The Comte says to the crowd, stepping ontop of a mounting block
    in order to be seen better. '
  - '"Ah, it appears that your phantom heiress is about as real as your chance of
    finding your son a wife!" Guillaume cackles, to the growing amusement of the confused
    crowd. "Perhaps you would do better by being more prudent next time, <i>non</i>?"'
  - "\"Monsieur de Sabl\xE9! I should have known this was your doing!\" The Comte
    de Sanson shouts, his face growing paler by the moment as he comes to realize
    how foolish he looks at this moment."
  - You thirstily memorize every detail of the proceedings, as this is the sort of
    thing Pierre lives for. While you're occupied with that, you feel Guillaume quietly
    press a small cloth pouch into your hands.
  - '(You have gained a piece of Outrageous Crown Gossip)

    (You have gained 50 Livres)'
  - The shouting between the two men begins to escalate, and the crowd laps it up
    with astonishng hunger. Youre not quite certain who is winning this particular
