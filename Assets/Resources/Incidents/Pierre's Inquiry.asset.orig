    and he seems quite enthused by your presence. \u201CWhy, if it isn\u2019t my newest
    confidant! Please come in! Have you come back with more delicious information,

    that I already like you more than some of the men that are looking for him.\u201D"

    curiosity. How well do you really know your beloved Armand?\u201D"

    Armand has been so thoughtless as to abandon you in this cruel city, this den
    of vipers, and now you seek to chart your own course, <i>non</i>?\u201D\r"

    of chasing his.\u201D"

    hint of reaction. \r"

    and my keen journalistic senses are never wrong! Your beloved Armand was quite
    the social butterfly, and he mentioned you often.\u201D\r"
