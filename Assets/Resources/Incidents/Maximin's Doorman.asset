  - 'When your carriage drops you off at the party, you find yourself waiting in line
    for quite some time. Looking at the other guests, you wonder if you''re underdressed...
    or overdressed, it''s honestly hard to tell. '
  - "\u201CName, madame?\u201D he asks expectantly."
  - "The doorman looks perplexed at you for a moment, flipping through his ledger.
    \u201CI do not see your name here, madame\u2026\u201D\r"
  - "The valet looks shocked. \u201CBaron de Marbo? Why are you dressed-\u201D"
  - "\u201CAh, that is most unfortunate.\u201D the doorman replies, surprisingly disappointed.
    \u201CBaron de Termes was so looking forward to seeing him tonight. Please convey
    our deepest regrets at his absence.\u201D\r"
  - "He frowns at your irritation, but only for a moment. The doorman flips back and
    forth between the pages of his ledger before his finds what he\u2019s looking
    for. \u201CAh yes! You are the date to Baron Armand de Marbo. If I so remember,
    you are his fianc\xE9e, <i>non</i>?\u201D\r"
  - "A moment later he composes himself. \r\u201CAh, I see, you are the Baron\u2019s
    date. My apologies\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIs there anything I can get you?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CAh yes, absolutely madame. The Baron shall hear of it quite soon.\u201D\r\n\r\r\nYou
    hear some murmurs from other guests in the Vestibule. Your gratitude and enthusiasm
    seem to have made an impression on them, though the doorman seems rather unphased.\r"
  - "With a small flourish, you present a bottle of wine you had the forethought to
    bring earlier. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but the gesture is more important.\r"
  - "He glances about the room expectantly. \u201CAnd\u2026 where may I find the good
    Baron?\u201D\r"
  - "The doorman\u2019s eyes widen in surprise, that was certainly not the sort of
    answer he was expecting. \u201COh my Madame, what an unfortunate turn of events.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou must be quite upset, is there anything I can get you?\u201D\r"
  - "Before you can ask any other questions, he bows deeply to you.\r\n\n\u201C<i>Pardon
    moi, madame</i>. Baron de Termes instructed me specifically, to inform him as
    soon as you had arrived. We\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201D"
  - "\u201CEnjoy the party.\u201D He says with a smile, before leaving.\r"
  - "You hear some appreciative murmurs from other guests in the vestibule. Your gratitude
    and enthusiasm seem to have made an impression on them, eliminating some of the
    tension in the air.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the doorman himself seems rather unphased.\r"
  - "(You have gained a little credibility)\r"
  - "(You have spent 5 Livres)\r"
  - "(You have lost a little peril)\n(You have gained a little credibility)\r"
  - "\"Ah, <i>merci beaucoups</i> madame, I shall make sure the Baron is aware of
    your generosity.\" Turning from you, the doorman waves imperiously to another
    servant nearby, who takes the bottle from you. Afterwards, that servant dutifully
    scurries away.\r"
  - (You have gained a peice of Cheap Revolution Gossip. This will be useful later.)
  - "Immediately upon entering the vestibule, you\x19're greeted by a doorman holding
    a small ledger. While he isn\x19't physically barring your entry, his manner certainly
    is."
  - While you find yourself unable to determine your standing in the world of fashion,
    you do manage to overhear an interesting rumor while in line. You make a mental
    note of it, just in case.
