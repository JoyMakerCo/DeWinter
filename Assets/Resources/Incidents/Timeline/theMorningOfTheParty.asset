  - You awaken to the vision of sunlight filtering through the shutters, scattering
    sunbeams across this dusty bedroom. It takes a few minutes before you groggily
    remember the events that brought you here. You also remember that tonight, you
    have a party to attend.
  - '"Madame, when would you like to start getting ready?"'
  - '"That''s good to hear! These preparations always seem to take all day. On days
    where you have a party, you won''t really have time to spend exploring Paris."'
  - '"Once you go to your wardrobe, we can get started!"'
  - Camille winces at this statement, and looks at the floor. "I don't know how to
    tell you this, madame, but party preparations for a woman of your station usually
    take all day. On days where you have a party, you won't really have time to spend
    exploring Paris."
  - '"Ah, but of course you are, madame!" Camille laughs, following you as you start
    to get ready for the party tonight.'
  - '"Don''t worry, madame! A glamorous woman, like yourself, is sure to catch on
    quickly!"'
  - 'Camille enters your bedroom, already full of cheer. '
  _linkText:
  - '"If this is as important as the invitation makes it seem, I should start preparing
    now."'
  - 
  - '"Not yet, Camille. I still have some things that I need to take care of, today."'
  - 
  - '"Don''t worry, Camille, I''m already quite good at this." <No Tutorial>'
  - '"I''ve never really done anything like this. Is there anything I should know?"
    <Tutorial>'
