  - The debates in the Estates General have only been growing in intensity.
  - Every representative, from every estate, originally arrived with a long list of
    the complaints collected from the people of their respective <i>bailage</i>. However,
    how they pursue those complaits is entirely up to them.
  - This was further reinforced when representative from the third estate recently
    stood up to read aloud the reports of his people surrounding the <i>gabelle</i>,
    a deeply unpopular tax on salt, enforced by oftentimes violent collectors.
  - 'Unfortunately for him, this particulalry flowery outburst was dismissed as emotional
    rambling. Regardless of the facts of the grievance, his words have only been greeted
    with mockery by the press. '
  - This particularly flowery turn of phrase has been seen to perfectly encapsulate
    the rancor felt from the common people, and has circulated far and wide beyond
    the halls of the Estates General. Newspapsers started reprinting the quote almost
    immediately.
  - '(The Revolution has gained a little power)

    (The Bourgeoisie has gained a little power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - '(The Revolution has lost a little power)

    (The Bourgeoisie has lost a little power)'
  - This has led to a stark difference between the rhetoric of the nobility in the
    second estate, and that of the representatives of the commoners in the third estate.
    While the second estate preaches civility, unity, and staying the course, the
    third estate brings only reports of grievances and discord.
  - He spoke of these salt tax collectors as "those bloodsuckers of the nation, who
    quaff the tears of the unfortunate from their goblets of gold."
  - This has been galvanizing for both the Revolutionaries trying to help the common
    man, and the wealthy merchants of the Bourgeoisie, who have also been deeply affected
    by these taxes.
  - This has been hard for both the Revolutionaries trying to help the common man,
    and the wealthy merchants of the Bourgeoisie, who have also been deeply affected
    by these taxes.
