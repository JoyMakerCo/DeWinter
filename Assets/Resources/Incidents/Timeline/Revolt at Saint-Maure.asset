  _nodeText:
  - Word has drifted in of a violent rebellion at Saint-Maure, a small commune to
    the southeast of Paris. Commoners and artisans, fed up with the extortianate price
    of bread, have taken both the problem and hatchets, into their own hands.
  - Frantic bread merchants requested aid from a nearby military regiment, but there
    was concern the hastily mobilized force might not be enough.
  - The Regiment d'Anjou managed to dispatch over a hundred soldiers on short notice
    to succesfully put down this rebellion with muskets and bayonets.
  - However, the under supplied Regiment d'Anjou was already overburdened by other
    tasks when the call for aid came in. By the time they managed to respond to the
    crisis, the looters had already fled with their spoils.
  - However, the under supplied Regiment d'Anjou was already overburdened by other
    tasks when the call for aid came in. By the time they managed to respond to the
    crisis, the looters had already fled with their spoils.
  - The merchants from the Bourgeoisie blame this lackluster response on the rumors
    of revolutioanry sentiments swirling amongst the ranks of the enlisted soldiers.
    They are absolutely livid, and decry this violence as the fault of the revolutionary
    nationalists.
  - The merchants from the Bourgeoisie blame this lackluster response on royal officials
    from the Crown not caring enough about the woes of the common people. Revolutionary
    nationalists have capitalized on this and approached the merchants for talks on
    how to prevent this in the future.
  - The blood hadn't even finished drying in the streets before the merchants from
    the Bourgeoisie expressed their support for the Crown's ability to succesfully
    keep order and protect their businesses in a time of crisis
  - However, the enlisted soldiers of the Regiment d'Anjou refused to respond to this
    call, citing a mutual cause with the looting commoners. In fact, you've heard
    that some soldiers from the regiment were seen protecting the looters and helping
    distribute the stolen food.
  - The merchants from the Bourgeoisie are absolutely livid, and have publicly decried
    these violent revolutionary actions. By contrast, the delinquent regiment has
    recieved nothing but praise from common poeple, who see them as agents of justice.
  - '(The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Revolution some)

    (The Bourgeoisie has lost a little power)'
  - '(The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Crown some)

    (The Bourgeoisie has lost a little power)'
  - '(The Crown has gained some power)

    (The Bourgeosie has moved closer to the Crown by some)'
  - '(The Bourgeoisie has moved closer to the Crown by a decent amount)

    (The Bourgeoisie has lost quite a bit of power)

    (The Military has moved closer to the Revolution by a decent amount)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
