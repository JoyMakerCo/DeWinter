  - 'While your own progress has ground to a halt, it feels like the advancement
    of time around you has only sped up. '
  - Last year, in October, a large crowd of women marched upon Versailles to demand
    bread, mostly armed with homemade pikes. However, this crowd was disjointed and
    sporadic, with many deserting upon seeing the armed guards at the palace.
  - Last year, in October, thousands of angry women marched from Paris, mostly armed
    with homemade pikes, to besiege the Palace at Versailles. The Crown, lacking
    power and useful allies, had a skeleton crew of guards left to defend themselves.
  - Late in the night, they stormed the palace, killed what guards they found, and
    captured the royal family. This angry mob escorted the royal family back to Paris,
    growing more agitated by the minute. Only the gallant intervention of the Marquis
    de Lafayette prevented further violence.
  - Now more recently, this revolutionary fervor has reached the highest levels of
    nobility, with the abolition of all noble titles, orders, and other symbols of
    the <i>ancien regime</i>.
  - 'Scores of young nobles have pledged their lives to the cause of liberty, and
    have willingly cast aside their own privileges in the name of reforming the nation.
    It is a heady time, indeed. '
  - When their demands went unanswered, the mob attempted to storm the palace to
    present their demands to the royal family. In response, the guards opened fire,
    dispersing the crowd with force. Revolutionaries have come to refer to this tragic
    event as 'The Women's Massacre'.
  - 'This sudden violence began a string of defeats that the Revolution is still
    reeling from to this day. The Crown has the stability and the necessary alliances
    to suppress any threats to their power as soon as they arise, preventing them
    from gaining momentum. '
  - Paranoia and desertion have withered the revolutionary ranks, as the Crown recently
    released an edict of mercy, promising legal clemency to any revolutionary that
    throws down their arms. This edict excludes all that have been branded as 'revolutionary
    leaders'.
  - And so, Paris continues to burn.
  - Monarchist elements of the nobility have been angered and alienated by this move,
    but their influence upon the country dwindles every week.
  - The king met with the crowd and even had food delivered to them from the royal
    stores, but after months of famine, they were no longer satisfied with a simple
    meal.
