  - You wake up and stretch, feeling a twinge in your back as you curse whatever
    contorted position you managed to fall asleep in last night. Judging from the
    noise outside, Paris has yet to become anymore peaceful during your night's rest.
  - Just as you wonder what Camille has prepared for your breakfast, you notice the
    faint smell of perfume. It's both floral and bitter.
  - There's a letter on the bedside table. Judging from the rich purple of the wax
    seal, as well as the scent of the perfume, it was definitely sent by Madame Gazel.
  - You open it, and begin to read the letter. The flowing cursive of her handwriting
    is both beautiful and familiar.
  - "\x18'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette,,\n\nAs of late, I've been feeling even better than
    I did at the beginning of our last fateful encounter. My gardens are doing especially
