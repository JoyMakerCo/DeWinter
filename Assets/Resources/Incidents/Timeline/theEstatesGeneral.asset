  _nodeText:
  - 'Yesterday, with great fanfare, the Estates General finally convened. This great
    meeting is the result of His Majesty, the King, calling together all three estates
    of France to debate and vote upon how the various crises ravaging the country
    shall be resolved. '
  - The first estate, the Church, sent clergymen from all over France. Among their
    number are everything from humble countryside priests in their black cassocks,
    to resplendent bishops and cardinals bedecked in crimson and gold.
  - The second estate, the nobility, strutted down the streets in unison. Bedecked
    in their finest clothes and jewels, they seemed like an army of swaggering peacocks.
    Theirs is the realm of tradition, privilege, and loyalty to the Crown.
  - 'The third estate, representing over nine tenths of France''s population, marched
    in stern and quiet rows. Dressed in blacks, browns, and other sober colors, they
    represent everyone from the highest judge, to the wealthiest factory owner, to
    the lowest peasant. '
  - Unfortunately, it has come to pass that while they were granted double representation,
    they haven't been given a doubled amount of votes. The third estate still can
    only cast as many votes as either the first or the second estate. This means
    that their double representation is purely symbolic.
  - Needless to say, this has made many people extremely unhappy.
  - In fact it's led to some within the third estate to-
  - Wait, what the devil?
  - Clenching the newspaper in your tightening clutches, you reread the article carefully.
    One of the men described in the article sounds extremely familiar.
  - That's Armand, you're absolutely certain of it!
  - 'Without any illustrations to speak of, you''re forced to carefully reread the
    short passage over and over again. Every tiny statement about the reporter''s
    chosen viewing point of the ceremonies gains a new value as you attempt to deduce
    where Armand was last seen. After checking your findings against your map of
    Paris, you think you might have a lead. '
  - ('Researching Armand' is now available to visit on the Paris Map)
  - In fact, you might be able to search for him today.
  - In fact, His Majesty has even seen fit to break from tradition to grant the third
    estate double representation. With twice the amount of representatives, they're
    closer to representing their own stake in the country, which was originally a
    source of great hope.
  - As part of the opening ceremony, each estate paraded down the streets of the
    city.
  - Long brown hair, young, and tall. Representing the nobility of the second estate,
    but has elected to merely wear a fine blue coat for the opening ceremonies, without
    other adornments. The article writer singled out his casual attire as disrespectful.
