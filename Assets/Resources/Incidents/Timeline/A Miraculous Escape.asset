  _nodeText:
  - Knowledge of yet another great scandal is speading through Paris like wildfire.
  - "A printmaker with political ties to the Revolution, one Monsieur Clet, has managed
    to escape the dreaded <i>Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes</i>."
  - Apparently, the commander of the guards tried to conceal this escape from everyone,
    including his own superiors. However, now that the truth has come to light, they
    all look like fools. Firstly, for allowing such a thing to happen and secondly,
    for failing to even perform a proper cover up!
  - '(The Crown has lost some power)

    (The Revolution has gained some power)'
  - Of course, nobody can truly attest as to how, exactly this humble printmaker managed
    to perform such a bold escape. Yet still, theories abound. Either way, his skill
    and daring are already being celebrated across the city.
  - Sitting at home, you feel a smug smile creep across your lips. Those fools will
    never know the truth.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
