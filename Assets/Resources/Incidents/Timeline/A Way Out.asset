  _nodeText:
  - You wake up to the sound of urgent knocking on your front door, downstairs
  - You can hear Camille go to answer the door, but whoever it is simply pushes by
    her.
  - After a brief commotion, a young dragoon enters your room. You recognize him as
    one of Alex's comrades. His uniform is rumpled, and he's breathing heavily.
  - After further argument, this interloper and Hansel enter your room at the same
    time. You recognize him as one of Alex's comrades. His uniform is rumpled, he's
    breathing heavily, and Hansel's fist is clenched onto the collar of his coat.
  - '"Madame, this man is here to see you. He appears to bear no ill intent." Hansel
    says to you calmly, but refusing to let go of your new visitor.'
  - '"Unhand me, you loutish sell sword!" The Dragoon shouts, on the absolute edge
    of losing his temper.'
  - Hansel doesn't dignify his demand with a reply. Instead he waits for your nod
    of approval, then releases the soldier and leaves the room.
  - '"<i>Bonjour</i> madame, I''m sorry to intrude upon you like this, but I come
    with urgent news."'
  - '"Alex is occupied with his other duties, but he''s sent me to deliver this."'
  - '"Alex may be dead, but we all know how much you meant to each other. To this
    day, you''ve always shown grace and favor towards us, so we wanted to return that
    favor appropriately."'
  - '"I''m sure you''ve seen the horrors unfolding in our very streets. While we''re
    bound by honor to fulfill our duty to His Majesty the King, we simply can''t guarantee
    your safety if you stay here."'
  - '"I''m sure you''ve seen the horrors unfolding in our very streets. While we''ve
    sworn to protect our fellow citizens to the best of our ability, we simply can''t
    guarantee your safety if you stay here."'
  - He hands you a peice of paper with an address on it. You quickly check it against
    your map of the city and see that it's a section of port along the banks of the
    river.
  - '"Tonight, at midnight, you''ll find a boat waiting to take you from Paris to
    a major sea port. From that port, you''ll be able to flee to safety anywhere in
    the world. There''s just enough room for you and the members of your household.
    The captain will only be there tonight."'
  - '"I imagine you might not be comfortable leaving so suddenly, but I urge you to
    accept this offer. I have kept a steady heart while musket balls flew past my
    ears, but the things I hear people mutter to themselves when I patrol the streets...
    they put a chill to my soul."'
  - '"Now, I must take my leave madame. Good day." He says with a bow.'
  - He heads downstairs, and you can hear Camille wish him well as he returns to the
    streets.
  - He heads downstairs and you can hear Hansel following close behind, to make sure
    the dragoon is escorted properly outside.
  - 'You stare numbly at the paper, eyes flickering between the address and your window
    looking out to the chaos outside.


    Leave Paris?'
  - At first, you almost reject the notion entirely. You've fought for so long to
    be here, to establish yourself. To give that all up now feels like it would forsake
    everything you've sacrificed.
  - 'Yet, perhaps it is time to start a life abroad elsewhere. Perhaps leaving Paris
    doesn''t need to be a deafeat.


    It''s a maddening conundrum.'
  - ('Emigre' is now available to visit on the Paris map, but it is only available
    tonight)
  - If you want to leave, you'll need to start packing now.
  - You can hear Hansel go to answer the door, but whoever is there starts arguing
    with him in a low voice.
