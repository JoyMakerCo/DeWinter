  - "Early the next morning, Camille approaches you, occasionally wringing her apron
    with her hands. She\u2019s obviously nervous.\r\n\n\u201CMadame, there\u2019s
    something you should know\u2026\u201D \rTaking a deep breath, she continues."
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re expected to attend a party the day after tomorrow, held by
    one Viscountess Marcelle de Foix. I mean, Armand replied to the invitation, but
    you were to be his date.\u201D"
  - "Camille looks visibly relieved. \u201C<i>Parfait!</i> If you need anything washed
    or prepared, just ask!\u201D "
  - "Camille looks nervously at the ground for a second, wringing her apron in her
    hands again.\r\n\n\u201CWell, after I told you about Monsieur Armand\u2019s absence,
    you seemed upset. I felt like the last thing I should do was give you an obligation,
    right after bad news.\u201D\r"
  - "\"That reminds me!\" Camille exclaims. \"If you\u2019re going to a party, you
    should probably make sure you\u2019re dressed appropriately. Fashion moves so
    quickly here that people retire outfits before they even wear out!\""
  - "\u201CFortunately, the bad news was yesterday!\u201D"
  - "At this proclamation, you can\u2019t help but notice that Camille\u2019s uniform
    has been repaired many, many times."
  - Camille continues. "Monsieur Armand was always going through clothes so quickly.
    He said that every outfit had a certain amount of novelty. Every time you wore
    them to a party, the novelty would go down a bit. In fact, even a little thing
    like wearing the same thing twice in a row could run the novelty out faster.
    Can you imagine?"
  - "\"Fortunately, he knew the most delightful clothier on <i>Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\xE9</i>.
    She runs a shop called '<i>Le Petit Mogol</i>'. I\u2019ll draw you some directions.\"
    Immediately she starts sketching some directions, mostly just simple renderings
    of local landmarks."
  - '"You''re expected to attend a party the day after tomorrow, held by one Baron
    Maximin de Termes. I mean, Armand replied to the invitation, but you were to
    be his date."'
  - '"I''m sorry Madame, but a Viscountess... it just felt above my station, so I
    tried not to pay attention whenever she came up." Camille replies with a shrug.'
  - '"I hope that helps Madame."'
  - '"I know that she never visited the house. Monsieur Armand seemed to like her,
    but from what I could tell she was a little... how do I put this?"'
  - '"Judgmental! She was a little, very judgmental. I hope that helps, Madame."'
  - '"I''m sorry Madame, but I don''t know much. It would have been improper for
    me to pry into Monsieur Armand''s affairs." Camille replies with a surprising
    earnestness.'
  - '"All I know is that this Baron de Termes is a very outspoken political type.
    Always going on about ''constitutions'' and ''natural law''. Monsieur Armand
    attended a lot of his salons, but never really looked happy when he came back
    from them."'
  - ('<i>Le Petit Mogol</i>' is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - '"If you head out today, you should be well prepared for the party tomorrow night."'
