        by Madame Gazel.

  - The sweltering heat of the last few days continues unabated, as does the discontent
    that you can hear, even through your shuttered windows. However, you also notice
    a letter on your vanity, sealed in blue wax.
  - You're already quite familiar with the seal, and the unassuming quality of the
    paper. This was most certainly written by Alex.
  - In your hands, a letter opener is as powerful and deft as a saber, and the wax
    seal falls easily to your attack. As always, his penmanship on the letter is
    disciplined and precise.
  - "\x18'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette,\n\nI would like to apologize for my absence as
    of late. As you can imagine, my duties to my unit have kept me busy indeed.'"
  - '''Still, that''s no excuse, and I would like to make this lapse up to you as
    soon as possible, if you would let me. Send a signal to me, and I shall whisk
    you away to a day of enchantment and gallantry, the likes of which you''ve never
    seen!'''
  - "<i>Tr\xE8s cordiales salutations</i>,\n\nAlex\x19"
  - ('<i>Monsieur de L'Humanite</i>' is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - You consider his offer, and realize that you could join him for this 'day of
    enchantment and gallantry' today, should you so desire.
