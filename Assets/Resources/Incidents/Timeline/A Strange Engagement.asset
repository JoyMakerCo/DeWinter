  - This morning, the city is abuzz with the story of a very strange engagement announcement.
  - The son of the Comte de Sanson, a known ally of Viscountess Marcelle du Foix has
    announced his engagement to a woman he's never met. Rumor has it that she is the
    heiress to a great fortune, which would be very good for his own family's finances,
    troubled as they are.
  - (The Crown has gained a little some power)
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - The son of the Comte de Sanson, a known ally of Baron Maximin de Termes has announced
    his engagement to a woman he's never met. Rumor has it that she is the heiress
    to a great fortune, which would be very good for his own family's finances, troubled
    as they are.
  - (The Revolution has gained a little power)
  - It's odd to be sure, but they plan on revealing her identity at some great social
    event in the near future. Until then, this royalist family's rising fortunes are
    the talk of the town.
  - It's odd to be sure, but they plan on revealing her identity at some great social
    event in the near future. Until then, this nationalist family's rising fortunes
    are the talk of the town.
