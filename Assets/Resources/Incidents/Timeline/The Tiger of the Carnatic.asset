  _nodeText:
  - News has spread of the King's meetings with an ambassador for Tipu Sahib, the
    Sultan of Mysore. The Sultan seeks an alliance against the British Empire, which
    encroaches upon his territory.
  - As a symbol of goodwill, the king commisioned the finest mechanics in France to
    create a small mechanical tiger that, when wound up, would chew on a tiny doll
    of a British grenadier.
  - It's presumed that the both sides spent quite some time bonding over their mutual
    hatred of the English.
  - "The King\u2019s ambassadors acquitted themselves well, managing to embolden the
    Sultan against the English, without overpromissing anything in terms of military
    aid."
  - However, there are grumblings of discontent. The Crown may not have been very
    astute in its negotiations and overcommitted its navy, which is still recovering
    from helping the Americans in the colonies.
  - (The Crown has gained a little power)
  - '(The Crown has lost a little power)

    (The Military has lost a little power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
