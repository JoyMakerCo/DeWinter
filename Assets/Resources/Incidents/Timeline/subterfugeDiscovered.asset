  - Reading the newspaper in the morning these days feels like an exercise in masochism,
    but still you do it anyway. You might as well know what, exactly is on the brink
    of tearing your entire world asunder today.
  - It appears the archers have been conducting more raids, as of late. They're trying
    to suppress any political organizations or clubs that are advocating radical
    beliefs. It might be too little, too late, but they're trying to maintain some
    image of authority and unity.
  - Your eyes suddenly stop at a name buried in the middle of the article.
  - Amongst the list of random clubs and societies that have been singled out, one
    of them is 'The mysterious and enigmatic Frankish Hapsburgian Society'.
  - Your eyes widen as you reread the article, looking for more details on the fate
    of Armand's society. It seems that many of them have been arrested and are awaiting
    trial, but there's no mention of either Armand or Johanna.
  - The article goes on to detail that this society is the same one that Armand was
    a member of, before he was captured and executed. It sends a wretched shiver
    up your spine to see that printed in a newspaper, for the whole world to see.
  - You continue on with your day as per usual, but you keep thinking back to that
    article. Something about it is nagging at you.
  - The archers state that they have not found the leader of this society yet, and
    are urging the public to come forth with credible leads.
