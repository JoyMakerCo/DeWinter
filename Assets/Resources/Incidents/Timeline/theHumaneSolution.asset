  _nodeText:
  - Less than a year after the events in Varennes, a physician named Joseph-Ignace
    Guillotin, proposed a device.
  - A device that will decapitate the condemned, quickly and cleanly. No longer will
    they twist and choke at the end of the hangman's rope. No longer will a missed
    strike from the executioner's blade leave a screaming man, begging for a second
    swing.
  - This 'guillotine' kills instantly, for if one is to die, it should be done humanely.
  - In fact, this device has already claimed its first life. A highwayman named Nicolas
    Jacques Pelletier, who was found guilty of murder, robbery, and rape.
  - By all accounts, he was a wicked man. In fact, the crowd that watched his death
    was unsatisfied with his execution. It was too clean, too quick, too clinical.
  - 'Perhaps they shall have to witness this guillotine at work a few more times,
    before they warm to it. '
  - And so, Paris continues to burn.
