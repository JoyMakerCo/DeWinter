  - In the morning, you awake to find a letter already on your bedside table, sealed
    in plain, uncolored wax. The wax seal hasn't been stamped with a sigil of any
    sort.
  - You open the strangely nondescript letter, and immediately recognize the handwriting
    as Armand's.
  - "\x18'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette, \r\n\r\nI write you now, to explain that the situation
    has become extremely grave.\x19\r'"
  - You recognize this peculiarly nondescript method of correspondence. When you
    open the letter and see the handwriting, your suspicions are confirmed immediately.
    This message is from Armand.
  - '''Our Hapsburgian society was founded with the intent of acheiving a great social
    change over the course of many years. These latest violent upheavals have shown
    us that our time is dwindling faster than we ever could have imagined. Simply
    put, our mission cannot be accomplished.'''
  - '''I know Johanna won''t like it, but I need to try to push for something that''s
    more achievable in our dwindling hours. I''ll have to do this behind her back,
    but I accept the consequences for that. This may be her society, but its mission
    belongs to us all.'''
  - '''Please stay safe,


    Love,


    - Armand'''
  - You put down the letter, and wonder about Armand's plans.
  - While you contemplate what you'll do with the rest of your day, you keep wondering
    what, exactly, Armand has in mind.
  - You shake your head to free yourself of lingering thoughts of Armand. He's made
    his decisions, and he will handle them himself. Instead, you focus on what else
    you plan on doing with the rest of your day.
  - '''To be honest, Johanna worries me right now. She''s growing more distant and
    agitated by the day. I know our circumstances are taxing, but something just
    doesn''t feel right about her.'''
