  - "'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette,\n\nI know this doesn't come at a convenient time, but
    with things as they are in the streets, I don't think we'll see something resembling
    a convenient time for quite a while. I want to see you, and soon.'"
  - "'You mean a lot to me, and I just want to find the right way to say it.\n\n<i>Bisous</i>,\n\n-
    \xC9lisabeth'"
  - ('<i>La Dame Des Beaux-Arts</i>' is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - "You check her directions against your map. It might be possible to meet up with
    \xC9lisabeth tonight."
  - The letter goes on to describe a location where you could meet her.
