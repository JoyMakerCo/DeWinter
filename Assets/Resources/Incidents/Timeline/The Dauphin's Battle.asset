  - It's an open secret that Louis Joseph, Dauphin of France and heir to the throne
    of His Majesty King Louis XVI, has suffered from grave illnesses since he was
    a young child. High fevers, and difficulty withbreathing have dogged him his entire
    life, and he's only seven years old.
  - While they have other children, this has been a source of great distress for the
    King and Queen, who had many difficulties conceiving children at all.
  - Her Majesty has put every available resource into ensuring their child's health,
    but the illnesses have seemed to persist. On particularly bad days, His Majesty
    has been unable to stay focused and perform his duties to the nation. He simply
    cannot take his mind off of the state of his son.
  - Yesterday, however, something unbelievable happened.
  - "Yesterday, the unthinkable happened. \n\nThe Dauphin died. It was consumption."
  - (The Crown has lost a decent amount of power)
  - (The Crown has gained a decent amount of power)
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - 'The King, seen to be in great distress, has abandoned his duties in Paris, and
    retired to Versailles to greive. His ministers attempted to advise him against
    this, considering the grave situation facing the country, but were ignored.


    What can one possibly say to man who has just lost his son?'
  - This news has already been cause for His Majesty, the King, to be more vigorous
    and optimistic. Having this great weight lifted from his shoulders will certainly
    allow him to be more focused on his duties to the country.
  - "Now, with the price of bread the highest it's ever been, and the royal coffers
    nearly empty, over six hundred thousand livres were spent on the young boy's funeral.
    \n\nThen again, the lives of princes has never been the object of economy."
  - The Dauphin has seen to be in much better health than before, and the royal physicians
    have declared him to be on the road to recovery. While the young boy is still
    unsteady, he's been seen joining his mother on long walks around the gardens at
    Versailes.
