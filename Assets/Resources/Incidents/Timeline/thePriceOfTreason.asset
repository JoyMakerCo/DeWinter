  - Sitting at your vanity in the morning, you read the newspaper while eating a
    light breakfast that Camille prepared for you.
  - The front page story is mostly concerned with a man who's been sentenced to death
    for treason. Apparently, he was the member of some nefarious organization conspiring
    against the King, and their leader is still at large.
  - You almost skip the article, until you spot a name... no... it can't be...
  - '''The now disgraced Baron Armand de Marbo will be executed via beheading, in
    three days'' time, for high treason and conspiracy against His Majesty King Louis
    XVI.'''
  - "Your blood runs cold as you read these words over and over. \n\nHow? How would
    this have happened?"
  - You'd only just managed to find Armand, and now he's going to be executed? How
    did he get caught? Did one of the Hapsburgians sell him out? What happened?
  - You still hadn't managed to find him, and now your first solid lead is learning
    of his upcoming execution? How the devil could this be? You still have no idea
    what had really happened to him!
  - You frantically search through the article for any clue as to where he's being
    held. It appears that he's being kept in a <i>Guet Royal</i> watch station in
    the middle of the city, near the square where they'll soon decapitate him.
  - ('This is Goodbye' is now available to visit on the Paris Map)
  - If you hurry, you might be able to visit him one last time, but you only have
    three days before the worst occurs.
  - Whoever this man is, you can't help but feel some pity for him. You've heard
    grumbling on the streets that judges are becoming more heavy-handed with their
    charges and sentencing. That they're hoping to keep order by making an example
    of a few criminals.
