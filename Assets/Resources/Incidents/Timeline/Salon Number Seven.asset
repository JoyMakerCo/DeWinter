  _nodeText:
  - Monsieur Curtius runs a runs a wax museum, <i>Le Grand Couvert</i>, out of Salon
    Number Seven in the <i>Palais-Royal</i>. There, patrons can spend a few coins
    to see the likelike visages of famous celebrities, gallants, and ne'er-do-wells.
  - "A few months ago, he decided to pique public interest by including various politicians
    and heroes of the moment among his gallery, such as the<i>Duc d'Orl\xE9ans</i>,
    and Monsieur Necker."
  - "This morning, however, Monsieur Curtius didn't see a throng of customers approaching,
    but a mob of armed revolutionaries, intent of seizing the wax likenesses of <i>Orl\xE9ans</i>
    and Necker for one of their demonstrations."
  - Panicing at the sight of this enraged mob, Monsieur Curtius attempted to bar the
    entrance of his store. Unfortunately, a simple locked door, and a few employees
    armed with brooms were not enough to defeat the mob.
  - Quickly deducing the intent of the crowd, Monsieur Curtius lept upon his countertop
    and beseeched them. "My friends! Monsieur Necker is forever in my heart, but if
    he were actually within me, I would cut open my breast to give him unto you! Alas,
    I have only his likeness, and it is yours!"
  - With a flourish, he presented the busts to the cheering crowds, who left his store
    in peace and marched away singing his praises in triumph.  The busts were paraded
    in the streets in solidarity with the nobility and ministers who have proven sympathetic
    to the cause of the people.
  - Enraged by his reaction, and his perceived sentiments against the common people,
    the members of the crowd took it upon themselves to seize the busts, then destroy
    and loot his museum. Afterwards, not a single sculpture lay undamaged, and not
    a stick of furniture was unbroken.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - '(The Bourgeosie has gained some power)

    (The Bourgeosie has moved towards the Revolution some)'
  - '(The Bourgeoisie has lost some power)

    (The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Crown some)'
