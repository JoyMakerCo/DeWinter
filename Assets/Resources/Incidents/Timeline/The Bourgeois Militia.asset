  _nodeText:
  - Only two days ago, Prime Minister Necker was suddenly dismissed by the king. It
    was a decision that did not sit well with most.
  - "Today, the members of the National Assembly publicly called for the creation
    of a 'Bourgeois Militia'. \n\nThey want their own army."
  - If that wasn't disturbing enough, it's well known at this point that this militia
    will have no shortage of volunteers. There are already fears that members of the
    military will desert to this new army, as they no longer feel any particular loyalty
    to the Crown.
  - If that wasn't disturbing enough, it's well known at this point that this militia
    will have no shortage of volunteers. While there aren't many fears of large scale
    desertion within the military, there are still a lot of angry citizens out there,
    and it doesn't take a lot of manpower to throw up a barricade in the streets and
    start trouble.
  - 'Then again, a large amount of angry people doesn''t make an army. While Paris
    certainly contains enough sickles, kitchen knives, and hammers to allow for violent
    mobs, any uprising would need rifles and even cannons to succeed.


    Those tend to be in short supply.'
  - This militia could overwhelm and rob the ocassional group of watchmen, or even
    a small military checkoint, but the only large concentration of weaponry that
    you can think of in Paris is the Bastille. The imposing castle used to be a major
    prison, but now it's mostly an armory that happens to hold a few especially odious
    criminals in its spare cells.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - Of course, that would be utterly insane. Nobody would try to storm a castle in
    the middle of Paris. That would plunge the city into the kind of chaos that one
    could never turn back from.
  - The situation is dire, but surely, everyone will be more reasonable than that,
    right?
