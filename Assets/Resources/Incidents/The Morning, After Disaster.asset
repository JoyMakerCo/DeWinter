  - 'You awaken the next morning, in a bed that still feels unfamiliar. In the process
    of waking up, you start to recall the last nights humiliations, and wish that
    they were merely the product of your fitful dreams. Unable to go back to sleep,
    you spend some time tossing and turning in bed before finally sitting up. '
  - "Camille pops into your room, already dressed and ready for the day. \u201C<i>Bonjour</i>,
    Madame!\u201D she beams."
  - "\u201CIt looks like you had quite an active night. Is there anything I can get
    you?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m sorry Madame, the other cushions are waiting to be washed. We
    can\u2019t have you end your life with a dirty pillow. It would be improper, for
    a woman of your station.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CUnfortunately Madame, the only things I\u2019ve killed are rats, fish,
    chickens, and one porcupine. Those didn\u2019t look very accidental either. I
    don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to help with a murder.\u201D"
  - "\u201CCertainly Madame! What can I get you?\u201D Camille asks with a smile."
  - "\u201CWhile you wait, I must insist on getting you something to drink. Going
    without wouldn\u2019t be healthy!\""
  - "\u201CNow, if you wanted me to clean up after a murder... That, I could do!\u201D"
  - "\u201CStill, I can\u2019t let you start your morning without something to drink.
    It wouldn\u2019t be healthy! What can I get you Madame?\u201D"
  - "\"What can I get you Madame?\u201D\r"
  - "Camille returns so quickly with the tea that you\u2019re certain she made it
    ahead of time. It\u2019s piping hot, fragrant, and not too bitter. You drink the
    brew in silence, the gears of your mind slowly getting up to speed. The tiredness
    fades. Your anger does not."
  - "A few minutes later, Camille returns with a decanter of red wine and the least
    chipped wine glass in the house. \u201C<i>Por vous</i>, Madame.\u201D She pronounces,
    before serving you."
  - "You drink the wine slowly, taking in the aroma between sips. Armand was always
    the sort to keep a few, particularly nice bottles on hand to impress important
    guests. The wine smooths the edges off of last night\u2019s memories, and you
    feel a little more ready to face the dangers of this new world that you\u2019ve
    entered."
  - "You take a few moments to finish your drink in silence and collect your thoughts.
    Something that keeps coming to mind is all the gossip you\u2019ve heard during
    your time at the party. Most of it was idle prattle, but some of it felt scandalous
    and valuable. Without an inheritance or a job, you\u2019ll need a way to make
    some money."
  - Maybe someone would be willing to buy this gossip. Is that a thing people do?
  - "Camille taps her chin thoughtfully. \"Well\u2026 when I was at <i>les Halles</i>
    the other day, someone mentioned something about a newspaper with these amazing
    society pages. I think it was called <i>'La Trompette du Peuple'</i>.\"\r"
  - "\u201CThey\u2019d have to get their stories from somewhere, why not you? In fact,
    I bet you\u2019d be great at that, Madame!\u201D"
  - With that, your day begins.
  - "Nothing is going to make last night go away. \r\n\r\nThe only option is deciding
    what to do next.\r"
  - With that, your day begins.
  - (<i>La Trompette du Peuple</i> is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - (You have lost a little peril)
  - You feel exhausted. Not physically, but in your very soul. Like your fate in Paris
    has already been decided, and that to remain here would be pointless. It would
    just be the humiliations of last night... over and over again.
  - However, stronger than that exhaustion is the simmering rage you feel. At the
    outrageousness of your circumstances, at the injustice of your treatment, and
    at the thought of going back to you tiny village, after finally making it here
    to Paris.
  - No. You must not go back. You cannot go back. Not while a single candle of your
    ambition still burns.
