  _nodeText:
  - "The price of food has been steadily rising for the last few months, as many farmers
    lost nearly their entire harvests in last summer\u2019s unseasonable hail storms.
    This was followed by a drought, and then by one of most brutal winters in nearly
    a century. \r"
  - "There are reports of starving people in the countryside boiling bark to make
    gruel. Desperate commoners are abandoning their homes, and fleeing to the cities
    for relief.\r"
  - "Members of the nobility, like the Duc d\u2019Orl\xE9ans, have raised money to
    feed the poor, but the problem is simply too vast for any individual act of charity
    to solve. Finance Minister Necker has spent over 50 million livres importing grain
    from the rest of Europe, but the famine persists.\r"
  - 'Rumors circulate about wealthy aristocrats with secret stores of grain, purposefully
    extending the famine in order to lower wages and improve their political power.
    Workers are demanding higher wages from their Bourgeois employers, who remain
    intransigent. '
  - They people are hungry, angry, and they want to do something about it. Soon.
  - The people are hungry, and angry.
  - "The people are hungry.\r"
