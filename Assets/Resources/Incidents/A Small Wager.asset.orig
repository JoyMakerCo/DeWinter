  _nodeText:
  - Hearing an outburst of cheers, you wander into a room to see what the fuss is
    all about.
  - "Inside, you find a group of men clustered around a table with a roulette wheel
    set up on it. Their faces are a mixture of fear, disappointment and triumph, but
    they're all obviously excited. \n\nAfter the latest spin, some grumbling is heard
    and some coin is exchanged."
  - Seeing you in the doorway, a man approaches you. "Care to make a wager, madame?"
  - '"Ah, you are a woman after my own heart!" He laughs, ushering you through the
    crowd to see the table itself. Some of the other gamblers laugh with him, and
    shout words of encouragement to you.'
  - '"So, how much would you like to wager?"'
  - '"Are you sure madame? It''s quite exhilirating."'
  - '"Oh, for a first timer, it''s simple enough." He says, ushering you through the
    crowd to see the table itself. '
  - 'He smiles kindly he takes your money "A most prudent choice for a first time
    player, madame."


    (You have wagered 10 livres)'
  - '"Fair indeed, madame!" He replies as he takes your money.


    (You have wagered 20 Livres)'
  - 'His eyes twinkle like diamonds as he takes you money. "A bold choice, madame!"


    (You have wagered 50 Livres)'
