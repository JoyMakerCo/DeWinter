        You didn''t think that refusing an invitation from a stranger was rude, but
        perhaps he was raised to think otherwise. Judging by the stares of the other
        patrons in the tavern, they seem to feel the same way as yourself.

  - 'You look around the unfamiliar tavern, trying to find Armand. Your eyes scan
    for his chestnut hair, your ears strain to hear the sound of his infectious laugh. '
  - '"May I... escort you?" His smile is broad and cocky.'
  - '"... something I offered to help you do." The man grimaces, and begrudgingly
    holds out his arm. You take it happily as he conducts you about the tavern, visiting
    all the places that you suspect Armand might be. A few of the patrons smirk at
    your clever ploy.'
  - 'Your turn around to find yourself face to face with an unfamiliar young man.
    He''s well dressed and handsome enough, but it''s the middle of day and he already
    smells like two bottles of wine.


    "<i>Pardonne-moi</i> madame, but I can never ignore the sight of a woman in need,
    and you appear to be lost."'
  - "The surprised man'\x19s face broadens into a happy grin as you reach out and
    take his arm. \"Why it appears that I arrived just in time!\""
  - His brow furrows and he turns up his nose. "Madame, I'm just trying to help. There's
    no need to be so rude."
  - '"Madame, I believe this is where we part ways." Your newfound guide says, gently
    pulling away from you. '
  - With a wave that is barely as polite as decorum requires, he departs to seek the
    affection of a different young woman.
  - '"Madame, I have escorted you up and down. We have sought your Armand to no avail.
    I have done my duty." He says simply, and shrugs. "Now if you excuse me, I must
    return to my compatriots."'
  - He walks away to rejoin his friends, who appear to be even deeper into the wine
    than he is.
  - '"Now, where are you looking to go?"'
  - This isn't the first time you've flirted with strangers since you were engaged.
    Armand often got so wrapped up in his political endeavours that you'd feel ignored.
    A few coy glances in the wrong direction were usually enough to get Armand to
    remember that you, and a world outside his furious letter writing, existed.
  - '"Well, that is what I offered to help you do." The man grimaces, and begrudgingly
    holds out his arm. You take it happily as he conducts you about the tavern, visiting
    all the places that you suspect Armand might be.'
  - Once that happened, Armand would woo you back from the hapless object of your
    deception and life would go on. Nobody ever got hurt, and there was simply something
    fun about it.
  - 'With that in mind, you stroll around the tavern looking for Armand, arm in arm
    with a stranger. Eventually, you realize that Armand is nowhere to be found and
    that your playful deception has been a waste.


    Or, at least, simply practice.'
  - '"I''m thinking about grabbing another bottle of wine, care to join me?"'
  - '"Oh madame, you know where to find me when you''re ready!" He says with a happy
    grin before going to request another bottle from the tavern keeper.'
  - "Sensing the shift in the conversation, he tries to win you over, but the drinks
    he's had finally seem to be catching up with him. \n\n\"But madame, we can, escort...
    there.\" He points towards a table that's crowded with some of his friends. One
    of them waves awkwardly to you."
  - 'However, after a few minutes searching the tavern, it starts to become clear
    that Armand is nowhere to be found.


    "Madame, I believe this is where we part ways." Your newfound guide says, gently
    pulling away from you. '
  - Before you can respond, with a wave that is barely as polite as decorum requires,
    he departs to seek the affection of a different young woman.
  - 'You take this opportunity to explore the rest of the tavern. Flirting with strangers
    isn''t half as fun if there''s nobody there to see you do it.


    Besides, finding Armand is your real priority.'
  - 'You politely slip away from him, and his increasingly desperate suggestions.
    You take this opportunity to explore the rest of the tavern. Flirting with strangers
    isn''t half as fun if there''s nobody there to see you do it.


    Besides, finding Armand is your real priority.'
  - He scowls and turns on his heel, muttering something ungentlemanly under his breath.
    Just when you thought yourself rid of him, he shoots you a glance that's surprisingly
    threatening.
  - Someone clears their throat behind you.
  - However, after a few minutes searching the tavern, it starts to become clear that
    Armand is nowhere to be found.
  - '"Oh, that is..."'
  - '"... not what I meant at all, and you know it, madame!" he replies with surprising
    venom.'
  - With a wave that is barely as polite as decorum requires, he departs to seek the
    affection of a different young woman.
  - You didn't think that refusing an invitation from a stranger was rude, but perhaps
    he was raised to think otherwise. Judging by the stares of the other patrons in
    the tavern, they seem to feel the same way as yourself.
  - (You have gained some credibility)
  - (You have gained a little peril)
  - Now you're truly glad that you refused to go anywhere with him.
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - (You have lost a little credibility)
