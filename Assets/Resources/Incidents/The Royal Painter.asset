  - "In one corner of the party, you find two guests clustered around a painting hanging
    on the wall. They\u2019re talking in low voices to themselves.\r\n\r\nYou pause
    to examine the painting yourself. It\u2019s a beautiful piece that show the hostess
    standing in a field, posing with her dog. The eyes and lips, in particular, look
    marvelously lifelike. \r"
  - "\u201CDo you have any idea how Marcelle managed to get this?\u201D A man asks,
    his face the picture of shock, not taking his eyes off the painting for a moment.
    He must know the Viscountess de Foix very well in order to use her first name
    so freely."
  - "\u201CI have no idea.\u201D the woman replies, glancing furtively around the
    room. \u201CEver since Madame Le Brun started painting portraits of the Queen
    herself, she seems to feel that\u2019s she\u2019s above normal social niceties.
    It must have cost a fortune just to make an opening in Madame Le Brun\u2019s schedule.\u201D "
  - "\u201CYou assume that Madame Le Brun knew much about social niceties to begin
    with,\u201D the man quips, and the two of them share a sly chuckle at the absent
    artist\u2019s expense. \u201CYou\u2019d think that someone who worked on commision
    would care a little more about what others thought of her.\u201D"
  - "The woman turns and asks you furtively \u201CAh! What do you think of Madame
    Le Brun and her\u2026 eccentricities?\u201D"
  - "Surprised, the man turns to you with a cocked eyebrow. \"\x1COh? You really think
    making beautiful work can justify her transgressions?\""
  - Your surprising forwardness leaves the room quiet for a few moments. The man and
    the woman both glance back and forth between each other for a while, trying to
    figure out what to say.
  - "\u201CHaha, yes, I think we\u2019ll all see that soon enough.\u201D The woman
    titters, trying to laugh behind her hand.\r"
  - The once snide guests stand quiet for a while, considering your point.
  - "Slowly they nod, and their faces break into polite smiles. \u201CMy, my, I didn\u2019t
    realize we had such a fan in our midst. I suppose one can forgive an artist for
    being so eccentric, as long as their work remains beautiful.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat
    qualifier at the end of her statement feels unnecessary, but it\u2019s an improvement."
  - "With an exchange of polite nods, you part ways with these guests in order to
    explore the rest of the party.\r"
  - "\"She's alright because she makes pretty pictures? What an insightful defense!\u201D
    the woman replies with such fluid sarcasm that you almost mistake it for a genuine
    compliment."
  - "After a period of awkward silence, the guests depart to explore the rest of the
    party. As they leave, you watch them whisper to each other and glance back at
    you, pointedly.\r"
  - "Finally, the man manages to say, \u201CAh, I see that Madame Le Brun has quite
    the fan. I must concede that there are few portrait painters who have so superbly
    captured the image of the Queen, God preserve her. I suppose that-\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CWe should go.\u201D The woman interrupts, taking her friend gently by the
    elbow and leading him away.\r"
  - "The two of them hurry away to another part of the party. While that certainly
    didn\u2019t make you any friends, you know that Madame Le Brun is a far more important
    person to be on the good side of, than two random hangers-on at a party."
  - "\u201CThe real question is, if she falls out of favor, would she even notice?\u201D
    Her friend asks with an arched eyebrow. \r"
  - "For a moment you feel close to these strangers, as you all laugh together at
    the expense of someone who isn\x19t here. It is a joy as old as time.\r"
  - You spend a few minutes with these guests, slyly passing judgement on various
    prominent members of high society.
  - "After a few minutes, with an exchange of polite nods, you part ways with your
    erstwhile friends in order to explore the rest of the party.\r"
  - "(You have lost some credibility)\r"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with Madame Le Brun)\r"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with Madame Le Brun)\r\n(You have gained a little
    peril)\r"
  - "(You have gained a little credibility)\r\n(You have lost a little favor with
    Madame Le Brun)\r"
