  - It's another warm, sunny day as you walk to Elisabeth's studio. A fresh breeze
    off the river Seine prevents the heat from becoming overwhelming.
  - Having been to her studio before, you arrive without any trouble.
  - You knock lightly on the door, and wait. Listening closely, you hear some frantic
    movement inside.
  - Remembering Elisabeth's need for discretion, you simply walk inside. The studio
    is exactly how you remember it, though your portrait's canvas has been covered
    with a cloth.
  - 'The door opens a fraction and you can see Elisabeth through the gap.


    "What did I say last time, about staying quiet?" She whispers to you through her
    teeth. "We need to be discreet."


    (You have lost a little favor with Elisabeth)'
  - Entering the room, a startled Elisabeth practically jumps when she sees you. "<i>Mon
    dieu!</i>"
  - '"Alright, I already have everything I need set up. Let''s begin, shall we?"'
  - 'Elisabeth heads to her canvas and throws off the covers, while you strip down
    and position yourself on the couch, the same as you were before. '
  - 'This time, she starts with her paints, filling in the colors that define the
    scene. While you can''t see what she''s doing, she tells you about the process.


    Getting the balance of colors is important to making a scene feel authentic, even
    to an untrained eye. Subtle details like the color of the light reflected off
    a wall can make all the difference in the world.'
  - An hour into the sitting, she laughs. "I like how easy it is to talk to you. Much
    easier than trying to reach out to new patrons. Half of the critics in the city
    already paint me as a conniving narcisist, and I'd hate to prove any of them right."
  - '"At this point, I don''t even know who would appreciate my work."'
  - '"You really think so?" She asks, already considering the idea. "I guess they
    would, and none of my commisioned work is truly immodest, so maybe they really
    might like my paintings." '
  - '"You really think so?" She asks, already considering the idea. "I guess that
    makes sense. It''s a lot easier to pitch yourself when you have something different
    to offer." '
  - '"That definitely makes sense." She admits, already considering the idea. "What
    I need right now is clients, and I''d rather have ones that can pay well than
    ones that can''t." '
  - '"Thanks Yvette! I''ll send out letters to the bishops in Paris tomorrow."


    (You have gained a little favor with Elisabeth)

    (The Church''s allegiance to the Crown has been improved)'
  - '"Thanks Yvette! I''ll send out letters to some of the military officers in Paris
    tomorrow."


    (You have gained a little favor with Elisabeth)

    (The Military''s allegiance to the Crown has been improved)'
  - '"Thanks Yvette! I''ll send out letters to some of the business leaders in Paris
    tomorrow."


    (You have gained a little favor with Elisabeth)

    (The Bourgeoisie''s allegiance to the Crown has been improved)'
  - 'The conversation trails off and you spend the next hour simply posing and watching
    Elisabeth paint. She seems more relaxed, as if a weight has been lifted from her
    mind. '
  - '"Alright, my hands are starting to cramp up, so I think we''re done for the day."'
  - '"Do you want to see what I''ve done so far?"'
  - '"Here it is!" the painter says as she waves you over to her easel. The wooden
    floor creaks under your bare feet as you walk over. '
  - '"Oh really? Very interesting."'
  - 'While the painting is obviously unfinished, it''s coming together quite nicely.
    The colors of the scene are balanced and you can see that Elisabeth has already
    started on some of your details, but everything is smoother. Cleaner. The kind
    of unreal beauty that you''ve seen in so many portraits of great men and women.


    It''s not you as you are. It''s you as you aspire to be.'
  - 'While the painting is obviously unfinished, it''s coming together quite nicely.
    The colors of the scene are balanced and you can see that Elisabeth has already
    started on some of the details that make you yourself. A wrinkle here, a childhood
    scar there. The minor flaws of your body, quite literally laid bare.


    Yet still, there''s an honest beauty to it, if you do say so yourself.'
  - 'While the painting is obviously unfinished, it''s coming together quite nicely.
    The colors of the scene are balanced and you can see that Elisabeth has already
    started on the details of your body. It''s not what you see in the mirror, but
    it''s a familiar beauty. A lot of time has been spent on your eyes, capturing
    something that feels passionate, yet calculating and enigmatic.


    It''s fascinating to see how you appear through the eyes of another.'
  - Afterwards, Elisabeth provides you with pastries and tea again. You get the feeling
    that she does this with all of her clients, but it's nice to have all the same.
    You chat and joke for a while, which is a lot easier to do, now that you don't
    have to hold perfectly still.
  - With things winding down, you decide it's time to head home. With a wave goodbye
    to Elisabeth, you take your leave.
  - "You turn your back on the painter and start to disrobe, one article at a time.
    It's slow, but confident. After all, if you had anything to hide, you wouldn't
    be here, doing this. \n\nLanguidly, you sit on the couch and remove your stockings,
    before posing yourself."
  - "\"Oh, I thought you'd never ask.\" Elisabeth replies with a sly smile. She helps
    you out of your dress, and slowly unlaces your stays, hands lingering on you all
    the while. \n\nYou're pretty sure it took longer to undress with her help than
    it would have taken to do by yourself, but that wasn't the point really, was it?\n\n(You
    have gained a little favor with Elisabeth)"
  - '"No matter, if anyone asks, I''ll just say it was a courier with a message."
    She says with a sigh. "Come in, come in."'
  - '"I''m sorry, I just didn''t hear you come in."


    She flashes you a smile. "Still, I''m glad you took my request seriously."


    (You have gained a little favor with Elisabeth)'
  - You follow her inside and Elisabeth closes the door behind you. The studio is
    exactly how you remember it, though your portrait's canvas has been covered with
    a cloth.
  - '"I don''t think I''ll ever get tired of that." Elisabeth sighs.


    (You have gained a some favor with Elisabeth)'
  - '"So, instead, I just sit around and wait for work to come to me, even though
    I know it''s unwise. Artists have to keep reaching out for clients, or we''ll
    never get anything."


    She sighs. "Yet, I''m so out of practice. What if I make a fool of myself?"'
  - Like last time, Elisabeth fetches some pastries and tea. You get the feeling that
    she does this with all of her clients, but it's nice to have all the same. You
    chat and joke for a while, which is a lot easier to do, now that you don't have
    to hold perfectly still.
