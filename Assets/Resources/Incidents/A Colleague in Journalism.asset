  _nodeText:
  - You approach a woman who's been eyeing the other guests in a particular, familiar
    way. In fact, it's exact same way you look at guests at these functions. She looks
    up at you.
  - '"Yvette Decaux, I take it?" She asks, sipping on a glass of white wine.'
  - '"Ah, I thought so. You seemed to match all the rumors I''ve heard."'
  - '"My name is Anne de Croismare. We''re both acquainted with Pierre Renaudot. Funny
    little man, isn''t he?"'
  - '"Hmph... I''d heard rumors about you, but none of them mentioned that you have
    no manners."'
  - '"Forgive me, but I''d be an awful gossip monger if I didn''t. You''re quite the
    popular subject of conversation, after all." '
  - '"I used to work for him as a rumor monger, a long time ago before his boss passed
    away and bequeathed him the newspaper."'
  - '"However, I''ve heard that he''s even gone so far as to promote you to being
    his journalist. Either that was very difficult, or he''s getting desperate."'
  - '"Of course, since then I''ve moved on, to greener pastures."'
  - '"How''s Pierre''s doing, by the way? Does he still gamble like a madman?"'
  - '"Yet somehow, I swear that weasel of a man will manage to outlive us all."'
  - '"Hah! Can you imagine?" She laughs. "I once saw the man wager a full week''s
    wages on wig louse racing."'
  - '"Well, when the Crown finally put a halt to royal censorship, newspapers started
    cropping up everywhere. Suddenly, it became clear that Pierre was only a big fish
    because he''d been swimming in a little pond."'
  - '"By the way, I''m not certain what you''re doing here tonight, but I''m here
    to ''interview'' the <i>Comte de Boulainvilliers</i>. I mean, he doesn''t know
    it''s an interview, but that''s not important."'
  - Normally you'd think that she was joking, but this Pierre we're talking about
    here...
  - She chuckles into her drink. "Ah, he'll do that, you know..."
  - '"Simply put, I''m here to find something interesting related to the Crown. Can
    I trust you to stay out of my way?"'
  - '"Interview him together?'
  - '"You wouldn''t dare..." She mutters, fixing you with a steely glare.'
  - "\"Ah, <i>\rfantastique</i>.\" She sighs. \"It's nice to know there are still
    people with a sense of decency in our line of work.\""
  - '"I''d be agreeable to such a plan. If we both sold the story to our respective
    employers at the same time, they''d be none the wiser."'
  - '"I think not. I would have to be a complete fool to let you take this prize away
    from me before I''ve even started." She replies, calm and cold.'
  - But you're already off, in search of this <i>Comte de Boulainvilliers</i>. You're
    certain that this won't earn you any favors with her, but at least you'll get
    something valuable to sell to Pierre.
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - 'She gives you a nod and a smile, then steps away from the conversation to find
    her quarry...


    ...Or is it interviewee? Is there really a difference?'
  - '"For all of his failings, Pierre has his principles, and I admire that. However,
    you''ve seen his operation. The man is barely holding it together, and I couldn''t
    trust my living on something like that."'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
