  - Strolling through the party, you manage to spot Madame Gazel from across the room.
    She's with a man who seems to be very excited to speak with her.
  - Upon closer inspection, he is the only one exicted about this conversation. She
    looks absolutely apathetic.
  - Seeing an opportunity, you decide to approach them.
  - '"Though some might consider it a simple industry, there''s a lot more complexity
    to wallpaper importing that one would imagine." He says before favoring Honorade
    with a sly wink "And where there''s misunderstanding, there''s profit!"'
  - '"Oh wow." Madame Gazel replies. "That''s absolutely fascinating. I''d never considered
    that before."'
  - She is lying.
  - '"However, I''d hate to take up your time too much with all this talk about business.
    This is a social event, after all, and I''m sure you have a lot to attend to."'
  - He grins even wider and replies "Oh, don't worry yourself Madame Gazel, my schedule
    is entirely open!"
  - '"In fact, I-"'
  - '"Oh, Yvette! Is that you?" Madame Gazel walks over and leads you into the conversation,
    by the hand. "I''ve never been so glad to see you before!"'
  - '"Have you met... Monsieur Hervart?'
  - '"Oh, I''m so glad to hear that." Madame Gazel replies. The look in her eyes shows
    that she''s genuinely happy to have some assistance.'
  - Madame Gazel squeezes your hand so hard it goes numb. "Don't you dare abandon
    me right now." She hisses to you under her breath.
  - The banker looks puzzled by this new development.
  - (You have lost some favor with Honorade)
  - '"Ah yes!" Madame Gazel suddenly replies. "How could I have been so forgetful?
    Yvette and I have some business we need to attend to. My apologies monsieur, we
    must go."'
  - Then, he glares at you. It appears that he may be onto your schemes to leave him
    behind.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Honorade)
  - '"As I was saying, this is Monsieur Hervart. He''s spent the last hour telling
    me-"'
  - '"Advising you-"'
  - '"Advising me on how to best invest my departed husband''s fortune."'
  - With that, she puts a hand on your waist and leads you both away from the banker
    before he can formulate a proper objection.
  - '"Which, again I feel would only flourish in the dynamic industry of wallpaper
    importation!"'
  - '"Oh, I''m so glad that you understand!" He replies.'
  - '"<i>Pardon</i>?" Monsieur Hervart asks, taken aback by your bluntness. '
  - While Monsieur Hervart looks absolutely elated to hear this question, Madame Gazel
    does not. In fact, you're certain that if she rolls her eyes any harder, they're
    going to fall out of their sockets.
  - '(You have gained some credibility)

    (You have lost a little favor with Honorade)'
  - '"An excellent question Madame! I can assure you that my wisdom only comes from
    hard earned experience."'
  - '"I was an early investor in my brother''s wallerpaper importing company."'
  - '"That would be quite the revelation, Yvette. After all, Monsieur Hervart has
    failed to mention his personal stake in all of this advice he''s been giving me."
    She growls, leveling a stare at the banker.'
  - He sputters. "Well, I don't exactly-"
  - '"When, exactly, were you planning on telling me that this whole conversation
    has been a scheme to get me to invest in your business?"'
  - Monsieur Hervart looks up at some unspecificed point in the distance. "<i>Mon
    dieu</i>! It appears that I have another pressing engagement. I should go!"
  - While it may feel impossible for such a tall man to be able to scuttle away, he
    manages to do so anyway.
  - '"That was quite the interogation Yvette. It seems like you''re a little more
    dangerous than your pretty face would suggest."'
  - (You have gained quite a bit of favor with Honorade)
  - '"I never took enough interest in the specifics of his work, and now I''m floundering."'
  - '(You have lost some credibility

    (You have gained a little peril)'
  - Before you can get ahold of Madame Gazel, he's suddenly friendly again, and standing
    between you both. "There's no need to apologize madame! We shall simply walk and
    talk!"
  - 'Honorade rolls her eyes silently and shrugs to you. '
  - '"<i>Mon dieu</i>, you are a life saver." She whispers to you. "If I had to tolerate
    that any longer, I would have gouged my own eyes out."'
  - (You have gained quite a bit of favor with Honorade)
  - '"Are you absolutely out of your mind?" Honorade whispers to you angrily. "You
    want him to talk about this more?"'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Honorade)
  - He spends the next fifteen minutes or so lecturing the two of you. While you manage
    to find a few interesting details in his speech, Honorade looks like she might
    burst a blood vessel if she gets any angrier. Moniseur Hervart doesn't seem to
    notice.
  - With his impression made, Monsieur Hervart gives Madame Gazel with a tastelessly
    elaborate business card. She does not provide him with one of her own.
  - As he struts away, Honorade sighs and takes a long sip of water.
  - "\"Yvette is absolutely right. Something about this doesn't feel right to me,
    and I shall not entertain it any further. Please speak with my lackey Ren\xE9
    if you wish to schedule a proper meeting.\""
  - '"No, it is I who shall not be entertaining this any further! I shall not be so
    insulted after offering my wise and humble counsel!" He replies with a sneer.'
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - '"Thank you for cutting that interminable man to the quick. I don''t believe I
    could have stood him for much longer."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Honorade)
  - He stalks away from the two of you, radiating anger.
  - '"Where should I start?"'
  - She bursts out laughing, and keeps laughing for a while. At one point you're absolutely
    certain you heard her snort. "Oh don't you dare!"
  - '"Oh, I couldn''t possibly agree more." She says in a low voice, leaning close
    enough to you that you can smell her perfume. It smells like violets.'
  - '"If there''s going to be any displays of wanton cruelty, I''m the one who''ll
    be doing them."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Honorade)
  - "Without a word, Madame Gazel's loyal servant Ren\xE9 interrupts with a look on
    his face that suggests something important needs to be addressed."
  - '"While it appears that I must go, you should write me a letter. I would love
    to see you in a place where none of these people are able to interrupt us."'
  - '"That is... if you''re amenable to such company."'
  - Without another word, she leaves. The scent of her perfume still hangs in the
    air. Floral, yet bitter.
  - "\"In fact...\" She says, before giving a silent signal. Her servant gives a signal
    and her servant Ren\xE9 appears."
  - He hands you a bone colored business card. There is no name printed on it, merely
    an address.
  - '"You should write me a letter. I would love to see you in a place where none
    of these people are able to interrupt us."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Honorade)
  - 'You take the time to savor the scent hanging in the air before tucking her business
    card into your bodice and returning to the rest of the party. '
  - You return to the party, taking the time to occassionally glance over your shoulder.
    Maybe it's just your imagination, but you feel watched.
  - Honorade sighs, and responds with a silent gesture of her own. The servant hands
    you a bone colored business card. There is no name printed on it, merely an address.
  - '"First, because he doesn''t actually care about me, just my husband''s money."'
  - '"Second, because he can''t tell when a woman wants to leave a conversation."'
  - '"Finally, because he''s a pompous ass, and I wouldn''t take his advice even if
    it was devised by the angels themselves!"'
  - '"Was that not obvious to you?" '
  - (You have lost a little favor with Honorade)
  - '"The worst part of all of this, is that I actually do need advice on what I should
    be doing with Charles'' fortune."'
  - (You can now go on rendezvous with Madame Gazel)
