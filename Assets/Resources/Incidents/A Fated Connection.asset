  _nodeText:
  - That morning, you sit straight up in bed, struck with a bolt of realization.
  - "You need Gabriel to prove that Maximin had an illegitimate child with Marguerite,
    and that he tried to destroy Marguerite\u2019s life over it. However, Marguerite
    won\u2019t let you do anything that might put Gabriel in harm\u2019s way, even
    if it lets her get justice on Maximin.\r"
  - "However, you don\u2019t need Gabriel, in person to do that. You just need something
    that the public would find convincing.\r\n\r\nWhat if you had a painting?"
  - "This would, of course, have to be a great painting. It would need to perfectly
    show the resemblance between Gabriel and his absentee father. It would also have
    to be made by an established painter, someone with a spotless reputation.\r"
  - "Wracking your brain for someone like that, you keep coming back to the same name,
    one that you learned quite recently. \r"
  - "\xC9lisabeth Le Brun."
  - "Le Brun\u2019s well known as an accomplished portrait painter, having even painted
    Queen Marie Antoinette herself. \r\n\r\nIn fact, she was trusted to paint a picture
    of the Queen with her children.\r"
  - "If you can meet up with Madame Le Brun again, you might be able to commission
    a painting of Marguerite and Gabriel by Le Brun by her. This would add an enormous
    air of credibility to any accusations you might lay at Maximin\u2019s feet."
