  - "You happen across a man with an arrogant air about him, talking to a woman. Well,
    it would be more accurate to say that he's talking at her. \n\nFor her part, the
    woman appears to be doing her best to remain civil, and just draw in her sketch
    book."
  - Before you can think of an acceptable retort, he pivots on his heel and marches
    from the conversation with his nose held high.
  - '"-and furthermore, it must even be obvious to you that your work peaked at the
    1783 salon. Why else would all of your portraits of women look the same after
    that?"'
  - "Taking a moment to acknowledge you with a nod, the painter returns to her conversation.
    Her reply is calm, almost bored. \n\n\"My clients dress however they wish for
    their portraits. My role is merely to capture them as they are in their lives.
    Is it wrong that so many women wish to look like her Majesty?\""
  - Realizing the ground he's treading on, the critic's reply is suddenly more delicate.
    "There is nothing wrong with an admiration for the Queen. However, that is not
    the point."
  - '"The point is that you''ve reached your cieling, because you stopped focusing
    on your own merits. Instead you chose to attach yourself to-"'
  - She looks to you "Madame, would you like to talk somwhere else?"
  - The critic sputters indignantly. "What? You can't just walk away from a critique
    of your work."
  - She's surprised. "Oh, and what is that?"
  - 'Madame Le Brun looks at you, dumfounded for a moment.


    "Yes, I am absolutely certain."'
  - '"You''re not my teacher and this isn''t a critique, because I don''t want one."'
  - '"But..."'
  - '"Critique is something you ask someone for. I never asked your opinion, so I
    don''t need to listen to it." '
  - The critic narrows his eyes and hisses at Le Brun "This self importance of yours
    can't last forever."
  - The critic's eyes flash with barely suppressed rage, and he hisses at both of
    you "Laugh behind your hands while you still can. This self importance of yours
    can't last forever, Le Brun."
  - 'He storms off in an angry huff, finally leaving the two of you at peace.


    "Well, that was satisfying to watch. I should invite you to some of my exhibitions."'
  - After a few moments of silence, she turns to you. "Who are you, anyway?"
  - '"I''m sure this is really interesting to someone, but I''m done now." Madame
    Le Brun replies, closing her sketchbook.'
  - '"It''s pleasure to meet you Yvette." She smiles with an easy warmth. "It''s also
    a pleasure to meet someone who doesn''t already know who I am."'
  - '"Ah, congratulations!" She says placidly. "May your engagement be untroubled,
    and carefree."'
  - The critic is about to say something biting before he halts, knowing he'd only
    prove your point further. Instead, his eyes flash with barely suppressed rage,
    and he shakes for a moment.
  - Acknowledging your presence for the first time, he asks you increduloulsy "How
    does one improve?"
  - He stammers for a few moments, fumbling for some sort of answer. Eventually, he
    manages "Well, that's not really for me to know, I just critique what is already
    there."
  - With a sneer, he brushes off your question. "How ridiculous! One's patron how
    no bearing on the quality of one's work. An artist must always strive to improve.
    Anything else is merely a waste."
  - With that, he storms off in a petulant huff, finally leaving the two of you at
    peace.
  - '"That was... unexpected." Madame Le Brun says, a little stunned by your performance.'
  - After a few moments of awkward silence, Madame Le Brun inclines her head towards
    you and says "Don't concern youself with him. He's just trying to show off. It
    was still a good defense."
  - The critic narrows his eyes and hisses at Le Brun "Go ahead! Laugh behind your
    hands while you still can."This self importance of yours can't last forever."
  - He storms off in an angry huff, finally leaving the two of you at peace.
  - '"Well, that was satisfying to watch. I should invite you to some of my exhibitions."'
  - "\"I'm \xC9lisabeth Le Brun, but please just call me \xC9lisabeth. Formality doesn't
    suit me.\""
  - With that, he storms off in a petulant huff, finally leaving the two of you at
    peace.
  - '"So, what brings you here?"'
  - If only she knew...
  - '"Oh, that''s a shame." She replies with a dissatisfied shake of her head.'
  - '"Oh, you like to play the heroine?" She replies with a surprised giggle.'
  - '"Well, if you want to get good anything, you have to practice." She playfully
    taps her sketchbook for emphasis. "So you''re in the right place."'
  - '"If I hear anything, I''ll be sure to pass it along. Though, I must warn you,
    I intentionally isolate myself from politics." She sighs and glances around the
    room full of aristocrats and courtiers.


    "Getting caught up in intrigues makes my work difficult."'
  - '"Though, if you thought he was bad..."'
  - '"I''m sure some will disapprove of your calling, but I wouldn''t worry about
    it. I don''t think society actually knows what it wants."'
  - You chat a while longer, but find that you run out of common conversation points
    a little quickly. Still, it's pleasant, on the whole.
  - You chat a while longer about art and inspiration. She's calm and kind, but always
    feels like she's holding something back. Halfway through the conversation, you
    realize that she's holding your hand while she talks to you.
  - '"I''m sorry, but I must go. There''s some other business I need to attend to."
    She says inclining her head to the crowds of people scattered elsewhere throughout
    the party.'
  - '"Unfortunately, I have to go. There''s some other business I need to attend to."


    For a moment, her fingers interlace with your own. "Still, it was a pleasure meeting
    you."'
  - '"Perhaps." She replies with a barely concealed smile.'
  - '"I think I will." She replies with a barely concealed smile.'
  - '"Perhaps." She replies with a thin smile.'
  - '"I think I will." She replies with a thin smile.'
  - The critic's eyes light up "Well that's excellent! As you can imagine, I have
    a variety of cases where your work-"
  - '"I''m sure that you do, but this stranger and I have a pressing engagement somewhere
    else." She replies, grabbing you by the hand and leading you to a more secluded
    corner of the party.'
  - Once she confirms that you're both alone, she drops your hand and sighs. "<i>Je
    sui desoles</i>, I just couldn't take any more of that."
  - '"I don''t mean to be rude, but who are you, anyway?"'
  - '"It''s pleasure to meet you Yvette." She smiles warmly. "It''s also a pleasure
    to meet someone who doesn''t already know who I am."'
  - '"Ah, congratulations!" She says placidly. "May your engagement be untroubled,
    and carefree."'
  - '"Viscountess De Foix..." She murmurs to herself. "Why does that name sound familiar?"'
  - '"Ugh, what doesn''t that loathsome creature hate?" Madame Le Brun asks with a
    roll of her eyes.'
  - "\"I'm \xC9lisabeth Le Brun, but please just call me \xC9lisabeth. Formality doesn't
    suit me.\""
  - '"So, what brings you here?"'
  - If only she knew...
  - '"Oh! I painted a portrait of her a few years ago. I don''t think it wasn''t my
    best work, but the pay was good."'
  - "\"That must mean that you're Yvette Decaux, I take it?\" Before you can reply,
    she chimes in again.\n\n\"Please just call me \xC9lisabeth. Formality doesn't
    suit me.\""
  - '"I swear that cruelty must the only thing that makes him get up in the morning."'
  - "\"However, if you're the latest object of his hostility then you must be Yvette
    Decaux, am I right?\" Before you can reply, she chimes in again.\n\n\"Please just
    call me \xC9lisabeth. Formality doesn't suit me.\""
  - '"To what do I owe this infamous honor?"'
  - '"Well, let''s just say he''s not even the worst one out there, and I''ve had
    a few years worth of experience to learn that."'
  - With that, she departs, disappearing into the crowd.
  - "With that, \xC9lisabeth departs, glancing back at you before she disappears into
    the crowd."
  - With that, she departs, glancing back at you before she disappears into the crowd.
  - With that, she departs, disappearing into the crowd.
