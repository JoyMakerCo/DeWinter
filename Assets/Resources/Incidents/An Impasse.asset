  _nodeText:
  - The political hobbyists of France has been breathlessly following the events of
    the Estates General over the last few weeks, and their watchful eyes have led
    to a stunning revelation.
  - A revelation that the Estates General has currently accomplished abolutely nothing.
    While the King has attempted to keep the discussion focused on tax reform to deal
    with France's crumbling budget, every single debate has stalled out due to fights
    over voting rights and representation.
  - Members of the third estate won't let this issue go, as they're the only estate
    that pays any taxes under the current system. However, any attempts to change
    this would be inevitably shut down by the first and second estate; who both pay
    no taxes, and each have just as many votes as the third estate.
  - Yet, the nobility of the first estate have managed to maintain the upper hand.
    They have the backing of tradition. Slowly, the third estate's continued demands
    for such an unprecedented solution in regards to representation have made them
    seem like bickering children.
  - The longer this impasse lasts, the more the tension will build. However, if it
    keeps building, then it won't be long before something snaps.
  - Yet, the bourgeoisie and the revolutionaries of the third estate have been slowly
    gaining ground in the public eye. Their claims that the system is unfairly balanced
    ring more true every day, as people all across the country starve. Every day,
    mutters of discontent grow louder and louder.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
