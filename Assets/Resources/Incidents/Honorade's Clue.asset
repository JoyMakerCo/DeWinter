  - "You leave the house earlier than usual that morning, uncertain of how long it\u2019ll
    take you to walk to the fountain that Honorade mentioned in her letter to you."
  - "Given that you\u2019re still new to skullduggery, you decided to dress in darker
    clothes, and stuck to comfortable walking shoes."
  - "Surprisingly enough, you manage to find the fountain without getting turned around.
    It seems like the perfect place for a meeting like this. There\u2019s just enough
    people wandering around that you won\u2019t draw attention, but also few enough
    that you\u2019ll be able to find somewhere secluded to talk."
  - "Looking around, you can\u2019t spot Madame Gazel anywhere, so you decide to take
    a seat at the edge of the fountain. It makes sense to be visible enough that she\u2019ll
    be able to find you without any flashy waving or signalling. "
  - "You get comfortable, smooth out your skirts and pause for a moment to reflect
    on the decisions that led you to a point in your life where you\u2019re having
    secret rendezvous with a glamorous widow to learn the secrets of your most hated
    enemies. If anything, they must have been some good decisions."
  - "After only a few minutes of waiting by the fountain, Honorade\u2019s carriage
    pulls up and Ren\xE9, Honorade\u2019s trust coachman steps down off of his box
    to open the door for her. It\u2019s the middle of the day, but the inside of the
    luxuriously decorated carriage is still shrouded in gloom."
  - "Honorade steps down from the carriage. \u201C<i>Bonjour</i> Yvette, I hope you
    haven\u2019t been waiting long.\u201D"
  - "\u201CPlease step inside, I would rather not share this information while in
    public.\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Je t\u2019en prie,</i>\u201D she replies, before offering her hand and
    helping you into the carriage."
  - "Madame Gazel laughs with an unexpected snort. \u201CI\u2019m sure that it\u2019s
    not. However, anyone who wishes to spy upon us already knows who we are. The very
    least we can do is discuss this in a place where they can\u2019t listen in.\u201D"
  - As with before, it takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust to the oppressive
    darkness within.
  - "Madame Gazel follows you inside and takes up her normal seat across from you.
    With a silent signal to Ren\xE9, the carriage takes off. "
  - "\u201CBesides, this dress is silk and I\u2019m not going to risk falling into
    a fountain with it on,\u201D she continues and offers her hand to you. Judging
    from her tone, you get the feeling that disagreeing with her logic won\u2019t
    get you anywhere."
  - You take her hand and get into the carriage. As with before, it takes a few moments
    for your eyes to adjust to the oppressive gloom within.
  - "She sips at her glass of water and spends a few moments simply looking you over.
    You\u2019re not really sure what she\u2019s looking for. After a while, she seems
    satisfied, and continues.\n\n\u201CSince you\u2019re here, I\u2019ll assume that
    you read my letter.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIt\u2019s possible that you\u2019re more forgiving than myself, but the
    thought of what happened to you that night still makes me livid. At first, I admittedly
    knew very little about Marcelle, but the more I started learning about her, the
    less I liked. Now that I\u2019ve gotten to know her better, I\u2019m not surprised
    at all that she would be so\u2026 contemptible.\u201D"
  - "\u201CSo, I did what anyone else would do. I held meetings with as many of her
    business partners as I could, claiming to be interested in investing my husband\u2019s
    fortune. They, of course, fell all over themselves in order to meet with me and
    try to part me from my late husband\u2019s money.\u201D"
  - "\u201CDuring those meetings, I asked about Marcelle\u2019s family investments,
    and pretended to be very impressed with whatever they told me. However, in that
    whole time, I couldn\u2019t find evidence that any of her family\u2019s investments
    were older than thirty years or so.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThirty years is a long time for a single person, but that\u2019s not how
    the aristocratic families see the world. The Gazel family\u2019s fortune is forty
    years old and we\u2019re still derided as \u2018new money\u2019\u201D Honoroade
    pauses to sip her water and sneer at some unseen adversary. \n\n\u201CAs if recent
    success was something to be ashamed of. To put it simply, why would her family
    pretend their fortune is older than it really is?\u201D"
  - "\u201CThat gaudy wretch is hiding something about her money. Knowing what she\u2019s
    like in public, anything she wants to hide must be dark indeed.\u201D"
  - "\u201CNow?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh my, yes.\u201D She answers, making no attempt to hide how much she is
    relishing the current situation."
  - "\u201CNow you pursue this lead, hatch a plan, and get your revenge. What that
    requires is really up to you. I\u2019m more than happy to provide you with information,
    but I think you\u2019ll be better served if you handle the rest yourself.\u201D"
  - "\u201COf course, you could always just give up, but I don\u2019t think that sort
    of thing suits you.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI like you, and I despise Marcelle.\u201D Madame Gazel says, a simple statement
    of facts. \u201CThe idea of you toppling that tasteless wretch is extremely satisfying.\u201D"
  - "\u201CGiven what I saw from you that night, I have a feeling that you and I share
    a flare for the dramatic. I expect that whatever you choose to do will be suitably
    poetic, considering what she\u2019s done to you.\u201D"
  - "Madame Gazel signals to Ren\xE9 and the carriage begins to roll to a stop. Pulling
    back the curtains for a moment, you realize that you\u2019re already outside your
    home. \u201CWhile we must unfortunately part ways,\u201D Honorade says as Ren\xE9
    open the door. \u201CI wish you the best of luck in your quest for vengeance.\u201D"
  - "She helps you down from the carriage, and with a crack of Ren\xE9\u2019s whip,
    her carriage departs and winds its way into the city. You stop to think about
    this new information. Marcelle is a wealthy aristocrat, but her fortune appears
    to be younger than she claims. It seems like this knowledge could be useful, but
    you\u2019ll have to dig deeper first."
  - (You have lost a little credibility)
  - (You haved gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (Researching Marcelle is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - With that, you start to head home, already planning your next move against your
    sworn enemy.
