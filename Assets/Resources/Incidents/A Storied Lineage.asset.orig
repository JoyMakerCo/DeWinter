  - 'Alex is once again walking you back home after your rendezvous. It''s unusually
    chilly tonight, so you both walk close together, arm in arm, to help stave off
    the cold. '
  - '"<i>Merci</i>, Yvette. It''s nice to know that someone like you has confidence
    in me."'
  - '"It''s so brisk, that I''m feeling up for a drink to stay warm. If you''re interested,
    I know of a decent tavern nearby."'
  - '"Would you care to join me?"'
  - '"I see we''re in agreement!" He replies with a grateful laugh.'
  - '"Why in fact, it does!" He laughs, mostly to himself.'
  - '"Madame, have you met us before? That''s hardly a possibility." He replies with
    a wink. Stopping at the entrance, he holds the door open for you.'
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - Inside, the tavern is small, but cozy instead of cramped. You can feel the heat
    from the fires in the kitchen, and a young man atop a small stage is tuning his
    violin.
  - Stopping at the entrance, he holds the door for you. You sigh, and hope this doesn't
    drag on for too long.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - 'Alex orders a bottle of Malaga from the barmaid. You ask for a pitcher of water
    to accompany it. If one isn''t careful, the hangover from these sweet wines can
    be absolutely debilitating. '
  - 'Both of the drinks arrive and he fills your glasses before his own. '
  - Stopping at the tavern's entrance, he holds the door open for you. "After you
    then, madame."
  - Raising his glass for a toast, he says "To quick decisions and life's little joys."
  - You clink glasses with him, and sip the fortified wine. It's sweet, and strong.
    The chill inside you melts away, almost instantly.
  - Alex pauses to contemplate the charms of his glass of Malaga by the light of your
    table's lamp. His eyes seem focused on something distant.
  - '"Malaga was always a favorite of my father. Even when I was growing up in <i>Saint
    Domingue</i>, he would leap at any chance to get a bottle of it."'
  - '"Then again, he often went to great lengths to obtain his pleasures."'
  - '"If that''s the case, maybe we should have met a few years ago." He smirks as
    he takes another sip.'
  - '"Me? You flatter me." He chuckles. "You should have seen me a few years ago."'
  - '"Oh, the usual. Wine... women... other people''s money."'
  - '"When I first moved to Paris, I spent years as a typical, unscrupulous rake.
    Strutting about the <i>Palais-Royale</i>, finding romance in the booths of Nicolet''s
    theater, spending far too much money on fine clothes and finer drink."'
  - '"He''d lived a nobleman''s life of ease, and he wanted the same for me. To be
    honest, I was more than happy to take him up on his offer."'
  - '"As fun as it sounds, I was just another jobless scion of nobility, living off
    of my father''s largess."'
  - '"He didn''t disapprove at all, in fact he delighted in my adventures. Sometimes,
    I think he was trying to live through me."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - '"Of course, to get that pleasure for himself, he first had to get us from his
    hiding place in <i>Saint-Domingue</i> to the the family estate in France." Alexandre
    punctuates this with a long sip of wine.'
  - '"So my father sold me. Well, technically, he pawned me off..."'
  - '"Exactly!" He replies excitedly, almost grateful for your agreement.'
  - '"Well, he was forced to it," Alex explains. "Even though he was the eldest son,
    and the heirs to our fortune, everyone in the family thought my father was dead."'
  - '"Because you can still sell slaves in the colonies, and I was one." He says,
    like it''s the most obvious thing imaginable.'
  - '"Let''s say that he had a falling out with his brothers that lasted a few...
    decades."'
  - '"My father owned my mother, so I was born his slave."'
  - '"Once his parents died, he could come out of hiding and claim his inheritance.
    But first, he needed to get to France to prove his legitimacy. So, he temporarily
    sold me to pay for passage on a ship, so he could claim his title."'
  - '"Once my father got his fortune, he bought me back."'
  - '"I''m glad you liked it!" He laughs, clinking glasses with you.'
  - '"What? Absolutely not! He did what he could to help me."'
  - '"In the eyes of the law, I was always a nobleman, even when I was a slave."'
  - '"Once I arrived, he hired tutors to make up for lost time in my education. I
    learned how to fence, how to ride, even how to play an instrument. All of the
    things that make one a proper gentleman."'
  - '"So yes, it just was a temporary inconvenience."'
  - '"He needed money to pay for his return to France, and claim his fortune and title.
    That''s why he sold me, to pay for the trip over."'
  - '"Don''t worry, it was only a few months before he bought me back, and brought
    me here. The second I set foot on French soil, I was a free man."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - '"The only thing that''s wrong are the laws that let people be bought and sold
    at all."'
  - '"However, to answer your question, yes. As his eldest free son, I''m the heir
    to his land and titles, should I choose to claim them... from his last wife."'
  - '"I''m not sure if I told you this, but what spurred me to enlist was that I wanted
    to show my father that I was a good as any other noble."'
  - He pauses to examine his hand in the candlelight, as if his skin could answer
    some long, unanswered mystery. "Of course, it happens that men like me need four
    generations of documentation to prove their link to nobility. That was something
    we didn't have."
  - '"Now, I look at everything happening the city, I and don''t know how to feel.
    Am I even a real noble? Or am I just a commoner whose had more advantages than
    most?"'
  - '"These days, I feel closer to the Crown. I''m a child of nobility, shouldn''t
    I serve that tradition?"'
  - '"I just don''t know."'
  - '"These days, I feel closer to the common people''s struggle for freedom."'
  - As he sips his drink, you catch a glimmer of something in his eyes. Was that doubt?
  - '"So, I enlisted. Father wasn''t happy, but I didn''t it anyway. At his insistence,
    I did so under a different name, so as not to bring shame upon our legacy."'
  - '"Then... he died less than a fortnight later. I never claimed his title."'
  - '"I was so confident that I''d prove him wrong. That I''d take all the things
    he''d given me and make him proud, even as a simple soldier."'
  - '"You know what? You''re absolutley right. I have a duty to defend my birthright,
    if not for myself, but for any children that I should have."'
  - '"<i>Merci</i>, Yvette. It''s nice to know that someone like you has confidence
    in me."'
  - '"You know what? You''re absolutley right. All over Paris, commoners cry out for
    freedom. Me, and my compatriots should be the ones to give it to them."'
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Crown somewhat)
  - "Alex sighs and shakes his head. \"<i>Je suis d\xE9sol\xE9</i>. That was all a
    little more serious than I'd intended.\""
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Revolution somewhat)
  - '"I suppose it''s true that I was born to a noble title." He admits. He stares
    at the lamp on your table, considering your point.'
  - '"With an endorsement like that, how can I say no?" He laughs. "I must admit,
    I never took you for such a firebrand."'
  - '"And <i>vive la roi</i> to you as well!" He laughs with a mock salute. "I didn''t
    expect you to be such a commited monarchist. Still, you''re absolutely right." '
  - '"I suppose that''s true." He admits. He stares at the lamp on your table, considering
    your point.'
  - With a great swig his finishes off his wine and drops some coins on the counter.
    You finish off yours as well, but in a more refined fashion.
  - That familiar smile is suddenly back in place. "Thank you for joining me on this
    little stop! I think I'm ready to do what I actually promised to do, and walk
    you home. Sorry again for boring you with all of that."
  - '"You''re absolutely right! I can''t betray my legacy just because of how I feel
    for a moment."'
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Crown somewhat)
  - '"Still, it doesn''t matter. Yes, I was born into a noble title, but I was also
    born into unjust bondage. That''s what the revolution is about, freeing people
    from the circumstances of their birth. Why can''t you see that, Yvette?"'
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Revolution, even more)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
