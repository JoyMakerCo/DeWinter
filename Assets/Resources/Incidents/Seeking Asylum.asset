  _nodeText:
  - A young revolutionary illegally putting up posters decrying the Crown's ineffective
    response to the famine sweeping France was nearly arrested today.
  - Narrowly avoiding the archers, he fled to the Cathedral of <i>Saint-Louis-des-Invalides</i>
    and tried to declare asylum within the hallowed ground. The Military has been
    called in to apprehend this criminal, as this cathedral is part of one of their
    complexes.
  - The problem of course, was that nobody has seriously attempted to seek asylum
    within a church in a very long time. Some lawyers would debate as to whether the
    legal right even still exists. The real question comes down to where the Church's
    true loyalties lie.
  - In this case the priests, claiming to be acting towards the preservation of order
    and public good, refuse to grant the young revolutionary asylum and turn him over
    to the soldiers. This is favorable to the Crown, but it has damaged people's faith
    in the Church's authority.
  - In this case, the priests hold fast, and extend their protection to the young
    revolutionary. Specifically they cite that fugitive has willingly confessed his
    sins, and that none his actions were crimes in the eyes of God.
  - '(The Church has moved towards the Revolution by some)

    (The Military has lost a little power)'
  - '(The Crown has gained some power)

    (The Church has lost a little power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - After two days of besieging the cathedral, the lieutenant in charge of the mission
    lost his temper and ordered his men to simply storm the holy building and seize
    the young man by force. This has pushed the Church's sympathies towards the Revolution,
    and has made the Military look like faithless brutes.
  - In this case, the priests hold fast, and extend their protection to the young
    revolutionary. Specifically they cite that fugitive has willingly confessed his
    sins, and that none his actions were crimes in the eyes of God.
  - After two days of besieging the cathedral, the lieutenant in charge of the mission
    relented. He ordered an end to the whole farce and let the Church take custody
    of the young man. This victory over the Crown's authority has made the Church
    seem powerful indeed.
  - '(The Church has gained some power)

    (The Crown has lost a little power)'
