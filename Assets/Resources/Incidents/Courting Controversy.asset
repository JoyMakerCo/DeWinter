  - "After your day together, \xC9lisabeth decides to walk you home. You sense that
    she feels much more comfortable with you now. "
  - The artist glances at you for a moment "Did I ever tell you what it was like to
    paint the Queen?"
  - '"It was surreal."'
  - "\"<i>Oui, L'Acad\xE9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture</i>... the most important
    art institution in France. I spent years trying to get in, but could never quite
    make it.\""
  - '"My heart nearly lept out of my chest when I got the invitation."'
  - "\xC9lisabeth sighs \"They didn't like me. My husband, Jean, is an art dealer,
    and said it was a 'conflict of interest'. What was I supposed to do, divorce him?\""
  - '"I''d spend the day relaxing with with Marie, Polignac, Rose, and the Queen''s
    other favorites in <i>Le Petit Trianon</i>, only a stone''s throw from Versailes.
    No court, no rituals, no massive ball gowns."


    She sighs "Just us women. Free to enjoy ourselves on our terms."'
  - '"But Marie loved my work. I asked her for a favor, she asked the King. Suddenly,
    I was a member." She says with a confused shrug.'
  - '"That''s the worst part..."'
  - She pauses, for a moment, as if she's not sure if she should continue.
  - '"They hated it."'
  - '"I was surrounded by all these men, these master artists, whose work I admired.
    I had to listen to them tear it to pieces. That my portrait was scandalous. That
    it was insulting. That it was unbecoming of the Queen."'
  - A duo of tears roll down her cheeks. "But it wasn't. My infamy only brought me
    more clients, and the common people loved it. Marie was more damaged by the scandal
    than I was."
  - '"Courtiers spent their lives scheming and lobbying to see Marie-Antoinette, Queen
    of France and mother of the nation. I got to know the real Marie, gentle and considerate.
    We would sing duets together after our painting sittings."'
  - "\xC9lisabeth laughs \"She could never stay on key, but that wasn't important.\""
  - "\"We became friends of a sort.\"\n\n\xC9lisabeth turns her eyes away from you
    and to the ground."
  - "\"Marie never questioned my motives. She didn't even think about it. She just
    did it. Suddenly, I was a member.\" \xC9lisabeth says with a confused shrug."
  - '"A few years later, I painted another painting of her, something with her children.
    I made what the academy wanted to see. More austere, more appropriate, something
    befitting the mother of the king''s children. Since then, Marie and I have lost
    touch."'
  - ' "I feel like I betrayed her."'
  - '"I had a good reputation, and I''d painted nobility before, even a few relatives
    of the Queen, but those were formal paintings. I would show up, chat with them
    a little, and try to capture the essence of someone I didn''t even know. Marie
    was something else entirely."'
  - '"Instead I met Marie and her friends at <i>Le Petit Trianon</i>, and joined them
    in their leisure. I saw them as themselves, not as the masks they wore at court."'
  - '"By then Marie had been rejected enough times to be sick of politics and intriques.
    So, instead she spent her efforts making a simple world of leisure in that <i>chateau</i>.
    Like a little island isolated from the rest of France."'
  - "\"My rival, Ad\xE9la\xEFde Labille-Guiard, became a member that same year. No
    connections at court, no back room dealing. One of the only other women in that
    entire academy and she earned it.\""
  - '"I wasn''t good enough to do it on my own."'
  - 'She sniffs and wipes the tears from her face.


    "Maybe, you''re right..."'
  - "\xC9lisabeth stares at you in silence."
  - "\"That might work.\" She says, hesitantly. \"The revolutionaries would appreciate
    my more relaxed and natural aesthetic. In fact, many of them have already rejected
    <i>L'Acad\xE9mie</i>'s views on art, so I wouldn't have to try pleasing people
    that already hate me.\""
  - Eventually, her mouth falls agape."Are you serious, Yvette? I've already hurt
    Marie, I'm not going to make things even worse."
  - '"Actually, that''s a great idea, Yvette! I''m going to reach out to some of them
    soon!"'
  - '"If this is a joke, it''s not a very tasteful one."'
  - "\"It was <i>L'Acad\xE9mie</i> that hated my painting, not Marie. I put my heart
    into something for a friend, and she loved it. That's what matters.\""
  - '"Thank you. I haven''t been focusing on what''s really important."'
  - You arrive at home, and Camille greets you both with her usual cheer. "<i>Bonsoir
    mesdames</i>!"
  - '"Just a maid of all works, madame! Can I get either of you anything?"'
  - 'The rest of the walk home continues in an awkward silence.


    After what feels like an eternity, you arrive home. '
  - After a long pause at your front door she says "I'm sorry. I know you were just
    trying to help."
  - "\"It was,\" replies \xC9lisabeth. \"Thank you again for your advice, and for
    taking the time to listen.\""
  - With that, you stumble upstairs and prepare yourself for bed. It was a good night,
    and you feel like you've managed to push events in a very helpful direction.
  - Your question draws only silence.
  - '"I think we both made some mistakes. Good night, Yvette." She says, before giving
    you an awkward wave, and heading off into the night.'
  - 'With that, you stumble upstairs and prepare yourself for bed. It was a good night,
    up until the end.


    Perhaps next time will work out better.'
  - "The tension in the air doesn't decrease, but at least it allows you some feeling
    of superiority as \xC9lisabeth waves goodbye and heads off into the night. "
  - 'With that, you stumble upstairs and prepare yourself for bed. It was a good night,
    up until the end.


    Perhaps next time will work out better.'
  - Followed by raucous laughter.
  - "\"Yvette, I didn't take you for the jealous type.\" \xC9lisabeth replies with
    a wink."
  - 'After a few minutes of the three of you trading jokes and raised eyebrows, it
    all winds down enough for you to excuse yourself. With your goodbyes said, you
    head upstairs and prepare yourself for bed. '
  - With your goodbyes said, you head upstairs and prepare yourself for bed. It was
    a good night, and you feel like you've managed to push events in a very helpful
    direction.
  - '"Perhaps, I should just..."'
  - She gives you a weak smile that's trying to be strong. "Thanks Yvette, but if
    should say the whole thing. I think this is good for me."
  - '"I''ll remember the 1783 Salon for the rest of my life. I made two paitings.
    ''Peace Bringing Back Abundance'' was there to show I could do more than portraits,
    but my real focus was ''<i>Marie en Chemise</i>''. I poured my heart into that
    painting. It was relaxed, calm and kind. It was the Marie I knew. It was the Marie
    I wanted to show the world."'
  - '"I heard it over and over again. ''The Queen made a mistake''."'
  - Her eyes glisten, wet. "They took it down on the first day of the show. I thought
    my career was over."
  - She stutters for a moment at your insistence, trying to weigh her options.
  - "\"Later on, my career was stalled. The members of <i>L'Acad\xE9mie</i> were blocking
    my membership. I ran out of options, so I asked the Queen for a favor.\""
  - "\"Oh, who is this delight, Yvette?\" \xC9lisabeth asks with a giggle."
  - 'You can sense a tension in the air, and it feels like she has something on her
    mind. '
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You've gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have lost quite a bit of favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You've gained some favor back with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(The Crown has lost a decent
    amount of power)\n(The Revolution has gained a decent amount of power)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - You're not certain, but you're pretty sure that you saw Camille blush for a moment
    when she said that.
  - It was a good night, and you feel like you've managed to push events in a very
    helpful direction.
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(The Crown has gained some
    power)"
  - '"Just because I''m painting portraits of some political opponents, doesn''t mean
    Marie and I can''t be friends."'
