  _nodeText:
  - You're awoken by the sound of a knock at the front door. Given the chaos of the
    last few weeks, your blood runs cold at the thought of what new danger this could
    bring.
  - Ludovico enters the room, dragging some bags and cases with him. He smiles, but
    he looks exhausted.
  - You hear the door open, and the muffled murmurings of Camille conversing with
    whoever it is.
  - Camille carefully enters your room, shutting the door gently behind her.
  - '"Father Sidotti is here to see you. He looks nervous."'
  - '"Certainly madame! I''ve already taken him to the sitting room for some tea and
    refreshments. That should give you a little time to get ready."'
  - '"I don''t think he''d be here this early, if it wasn''t important, madame."'
  - '"I don''t know, but he''s carrying a lot of bags with him. He looks like he''s
    ready to go somewhere."'
  - '"Which makes sense. The city''s been a little tense lately, and I have some friends
    who''ve already left for the countryside."'
  - '"If you need time to get ready, I can stall him with silly questions!"'
  - Before you can even attempt to stop her, Camille has already disappeared to do
    just that.
  - 'After a few rushed minutes, you''re ready to receive company. You''re not perfect,
    but you''re certainly presentable.


    Of course, your standards for ''presentable'' are admittedly more stringent than
    most, but that''s neither here nor there.'
  - As you settle into place, Ludovico finally makes his way in. He's trailed by Camille,
    who is still peppering the poor priest with questions at a breakneck pace.
  - '"...but if all the animals started in the garden of Eden with us, how did they
    get out? Were they supposed to stay there, or were they allowed to leave whenever
    they wanted to? Did all the animals eat the forbidden fruit too, and they didn''t
    write it down because animals can''t read?"'
  - '"Th- that would be an ecumenical matter." Ludovico desperately replies, as he
    manages to get her out of the bedroom and into the hallway. "Please take any further
    questions to your parish priest."'
  - Right before the door shuts, you catch a glimpse of Camille giving you a knowing
    wink.
  - '"Do you... do you live with that? Do you listen to that every day?"'
  - Ludovico pauses for a moment to compose himself. "I'll take your word for it."
  - He grits his teeth and whispers "You must have the patience of a saint."
  - '"Now that I''m here, I suppose I should tell you the news."'
  - '"Would you believe some of them even asked me to come with them? They said it''s
    not safe to be in Paris anymore."'
  - '"Of course, I told them that was ridiculous! After all, I should be here with
    you."'
  - '"Anyway madame, I''ll take Father Sidotti to the sitting room for some tea and
    refreshments. That should give you a little time to get ready."'
  - 'She leaves and after a few rushed minutes, you''re ready to receive company.
    You''re not perfect, but you''re certainly presentable.


    Of course, your standards for ''presentable'' are admittedly more stringent than
    most, but that''s neither here nor there.'
  - As if exhaling a great breath, he slumps forward. "Well Yvette, I wish I had a
    better way to tell you this, but I've been recalled to Rome by the Vatican."
  - '"They''ve read my findings, and they want me to board a ship out of Paris, tonight."'
  - 'He doesn''t say anything for a while. He just stares at you, and only you.


    Like you''re the only thing in all of creation.'
  - She sighs, and looks at the floor. "Believe me, I don't want to."
  - '"I wish there was."'
  - You hear the door open, and the muffled murmurings of Hansel conversing with whoever
    it is.
  - As if exhaling a great breath, he slumps forward. "I wish I had a better way to
    tell you this, but I've been recalled to Rome by the Vatican."
  - He rubs the edge of one of this eyes. "I haven't slept properly in days. I just
    lay awake, thinking about this. Sometimes, I think about discarding my vows altogether.
  - '"But I know that wouldn''t be right. I can''t just abandon this now."'
  - '"And, as much as they pushed me into this life, I still can''t do something to
    hurt them."'
  - He gives you a smile, but it feels forced. "So, unless you find out how to talk
    your way into becoming the next Pope, I don't think this isn't going to change."
  - '"There is nothing in this world I would like more than that."'
  - (You have gained quite of a bit of favor with Ludovico)
  - '"You have to understand, I never wanted to have to make this choice, but we don''t
    always get to control the broad strokes of our own fate. Sometimes, all we can
    do is choose to confront it with grace."'
  - '"You''ve shown me wonderful things, Yvette. Things that I''m not ready to give
    up on, just yet."'
  - '"Please tell me you''re not willing to give up on them either."'
  - He sighs with relief "I'm so glad to hear that."
  - '"I was afraid of that," he sighs. "I understand your reasons, but I was still
    dreading this possibility."'
  - He pulls a piece of paper from his bag and scribbles on it before handing it off
    to you. You see an address on it. "Those are the docks I'll be leaving from tonight."
  - '"Now, I''m sorry, but I must leave. I have a few loose ends I need to tie up
    in Paris before I go."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - '"Really? You would actually do that?"'
  - (You have gained some favor with Ludovico)
  - He stares at the floor and frowns. "Let's see... we can't leave on same ship together,
    as I'm not the only member of the clergy travelling on that vessel. It'd be too
    dangerous."
  - He pulls a piece of paper from his bag and scribbles on it before handing it off
    to you. You see a pair of addresses on it. "The first one is the docks I'll be
    leaving from tonight. The second one is where I'll be staying in Rome. I'll write
    letters to you whenever I can."
  - With that, he kisses you tenderly on the cheek, grabs his bags and leaves.

  - You're not sure how long you stand there, thinking about what just happened. About
    what this all means.
  - Returning to his senses, he pulls a piece of paper from his bag and scribbles
    on it before handing it off to you. You see a pair of addresses on it.
  - He steps close to you and puts his arms around your shoulders. "I promise this
    isn't the end. It's merely a delay."
  - Camille slowly peaks her head into the room, clutching a rolled up peice of paper,
    sealed in wax. "Madame, I think Father Sidotti left something on the floor. It
    looks like a letter." She hands it to you.
  - You gingerly open the letter, trying to keep the wax seal intact, and read it.
    This is his last correspondance to the Vatican before he leaves Paris.
  - He's recommending that the Church stay neutral, between the Crown and the Revolution.
  - You take out some new paper and a quill and write a new letter, mimicing his handwriting.
    This new letter is demand that the Church intervene on the Crown's behalf. You
    smirk and feel pretty good about some of your more evocative turns of phrase.
  - He's recommending that the Church side with the Crown.
  - He's recommending that the Church side with the Revolutionaries.

    You smirk and feel pretty good about some of your more evocative turns of phrase.
  - 'You take out some new paper and a quill and write a new letter, mimicing his
    handwriting. This new letter has Ludovico completely changing his position, and  demanding
    that the Church immediately cease its current support for the Revolution, and
    to put all of its power behind the Crown instead.


    You smirk, and take the time to admire some of your more evocative turns of phrase
    regarding loyalty and divine right.'
  - "With a sigh, you leave the letter as it is. The risk of tampering with it is
    simply too great. \n\nBesides, you wouldn't want to do that to Ludovico."
  - 'You take out some new paper and a quill and write a new letter, mimicing his
    handwriting. This new letter is far stronger in its language, imploring the Church
    to intervene on the Revolution''s behalf wherever possible. '

    You smirk, and take the time to admire some of your more evocative turns of phrase
    regarding innocent souls, and the ''true children of the Lord''.'
  - (The Church's allegiance has moved towards the Revolution by quite a bit)
  - You light a candle, and work delicately with a small knife to gently heat and
    remove Ludovico's seal from his old letter. You then carefully transplant his
    seal onto your new letter.
  - "Is this risky? Yes. \n\nAre you willing to just sit idly by and let the situation
    in France play out according to random chance? No. Not at all."
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - You hand the letter off to Camille. Without a word, she curtsies and leaves to
    send the letter to be delivered.

    of heart? Yes. \n\nIs the situation in Paris dire enough for you to just sit idly
    by and let things play out by random chance? No. Not at all."
  - (You have gained quit a bit of peril)
  - You look out your bedroom window, at a city in turmoil. You look down at Ludovico's
    note. Even with his hasty writing, his penmanship is immaculate.

  - (You have gained quit a bit of peril)
  - If you make it to the docks today, you'll be able to see him one last time.
  - '"I promise this isn''t the end. It''s merely a delay."'
  - '"However, if you were to find your way to Rome, I would welcome you with open
    arms."'
  - (You have lost quite a bit of favor with Ludovico)
  - '"However, I have my orders and I need to follow them. If I left now, the consequences
    wouldn''t fall on me, but they would fall on my family."'
  - ('Ludovico - Epilogue' is now available to visit on the Paris Map, but not for
    long...)
