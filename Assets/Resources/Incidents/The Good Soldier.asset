  _nodeText:
  - "At the sound of your approaching footsteps, the coachman\u2019s hand flickers
    towards his weapon. Turning towards you, he looks you up and down before he relaxes.
    With an apologetic nod, he gestures you towards the door of the carriage.\r"
  - The door opens immediately, and the man inside steps out.
  - "He bows to you, formal and precise. \u201CCorporal Dumas of the Queen\u2019s
    Dragoons.\u201D "
  - "\u201CHow may I be of service?\u201D"
  - "He nods appreciatively, breaking into a warm smile. \u201CAh, straight to the
    point Madame Decaux. Certainly, we can drop you off.\u201D He looks towards the
    coachman, who gives an affable shrug.\r"
  - "He glances off to the side and shuffles his feet slightly. \u201CThat does sound
    terrible. How can I refuse?\u201D\r"
  - Corporal Dumas holds out his hand, and helps you into the carriage.
  - Corporal Dumas gestures to the carriage, and you climb in.
  - "The second you\u2019re seated, the carriage takes off, working its way towards
    the main road. The pace is fast and purposeful.\r"
  - Corporal Dumas is across from you, not quite staring, but certainly assessing
    you.
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re not being rude, it\u2019s a fair question,\u201D he replies,
    flicking his rank insignia for emphasis. \u201CEvery now and again, someone remembers
    my father and sends me an invitation as a courtesy between nobles.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201COf course! I enjoy being the center of attention, and there isn\u2019t
    a audience I cannot thrill,\u201D he laughs. \u201CFrom the theater to the sword,
    I have repartee for all occasions.\u201D "
  - "\u201CWhen I wear these colors, I represent the Queen herself. I could never
    turn down a woman in need.\u201D He straightens up in his seat, looking every
    bit the man of action. \u201CBesides, it\u2019s the right thing to do, which is
    its own reward.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CDespite my considerable talents, I think they\u2019re really just inviting
    my father\u2019s memory, not me. Still, I attend because I\u2019d hate to insult
    the host by turning them down. A comrade of mine was nice enough to arrange for
    me to have this carriage for the evening.\u201D He waves around to your conveyance,
    which is probably only meant for officers.\r"
  - "\u201CLet me turn the question around. What was a commoner like you doing at
    that party?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re a woman on a mission, then?\u201D Corporal Dumas grins, offering
    a mock salute. \u201CWhen you find him, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll appreciate your
    loyalty. At least, I can\u2019t imagine a man who wouldn\u2019t.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHow tragic\u201D Corporal Dumas replies dryly. \u201CHe certainly wouldn\u2019t
    be the first man to abandon a good woman.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CAs you can tell, I\u2019m also extremely humble.\u201D He gives you an
    exaggerated wink."
  - "\u201CWhat about yourself, what happened in there?\u201D"
  - "Corporal Dumas nods approvingly \u201CI saw your \u2018performance\u2019 outside,
    right as you left. You don\u2019t seem very shaken.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CDisgusting,\u201D Corporal Dumas replies, his lips curling into a sneer.
    \u201CI have no idea what our host was thinking, doing something so mindless and
    cruel. They should be ashamed.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHow\u2019d you find yourself to be without a way home?\u201D"
  - "He chuckles. \u201CWell, you\u2019re here in my carriage, so I have no choice
    but to believe it. Unless this is some new sport, where beautiful women see how
    many rides they can get from gullible do-gooders like myself.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CHmm, yes\u2026 it\u2019s as people say\u2026\u201D he stumbles for a moment,
    as the words evade him. \u201CGood help is so hard to find these days.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIs there anything else you\u2019d like to know?\u201D"
  - "\u201COf course! I enjoy being the center of attention, and there isn\u2019t
    a audience I cannot thrill,\u201D he laughs. \u201CFrom the theater to the sword,
    I have repartee for all occasions.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhen I wear these colors, I represent the Queen herself. I could never
    turn down a woman in need.\u201D He straightens up in his seat, looking every
    bit the man of action. \u201CBesides, it\u2019s the right thing to do, which is
    its own reward.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhen you find him, are you planning on winning him back, or simply getting
    revenge?\u201D"
  - "\u201CFair,\u201D he replies."
  - "\u201CFair,\u201D he replies."
  - "\u201CFair,\u201D he replies."
  - "\u201CAs you can tell, I\u2019m also extremely humble.\u201D He gives you an
    exaggerated wink."
  - "\u201CWhat about yourself, what happened in there?\u201D"

    as the words evade him. \u201CGood help is so hard to find these days.\u201D\r"
  - "He sighs, and looks out the window at the passing scenery. \u201CYou made the
    right move. There\u2019s a certain kind of person that sees sport in hurting the
    vulnerable, whether that vulnerability comes from circumstance, ability, or birth.
    They\u2019re all the same craven creatures, that feed on feeling powerful. You
    can never let them see their barbs land.\u201D"
  - "\u201CEven when they sting\u2026\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou deserve better.\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re not being rude, it\u2019s a fair question,\u201D he replies,

    infuriatingly fickle. Still, here you can climb to heights greater than any other
    place in the world.\u201D"
  - "His expression becomes grave, \u201CHowever, a word of caution. There\u2019s
    more to this city than luxury, love, and knowledge. We\u2019re at the center of
    an empire, goods and treasure from colonies all over the world, flowing in to
    benefit one point.\u201D \r"

    an awful conversationalist. Please forgive me. What I mean to say is that Paris
    is beautiful, but life here can be just as harsh and dangerous as anywhere else,
    if not more.\u201D\r"

    taking my warnings seriously.\u201D"
  - "\u201CPerhaps I do. All the same, I hope you stay safe.\u201D"
  - "He smiles. \u201COh really? Perhaps I should be taking lessons in safety from
    you.\u201D"
  - "Your conversation dies down as fatigue overtakes you both. Soon, there is only
    the sound of the carriage\u2019s wheels and the horse\u2019s hooves as you wind
    your way through Paris to your home. You\u2019ve almost drifted off to sleep before
    you\u2019re jolted awake by the carriage coming to a stop. \r"
  - "Your conversation with Corporal Dumas continues for the entire ride. He\u2019s
    polite, forward, and seems to have a healthy respect for you. However, you find
    that he dodges your questions whenever the subject of his family comes up. You
    try to not let it bother you. Everyone has their secrets, after all. \r"
  - "The coachman opens the door and waves you out. As you\u2019re stepping down,
    Corporal Dumas looks out the door at your home and whistles to himself. \r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve
    chosen quite the place to live. Well, if nothing else, the rent will be cheap.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CUntil we meet again, madame!\u201D He calls from carriage with a quick
    bow, as they drive off into the night. \r\n\r\nYou turn to your home and see that
    Camille is already there, holding the door open for you."
  - "\u201CWho was that?\u201D she asks."
  - You step inside and head upstairs, your mind still reeling from the day's events.
    Slowly, you get undressed and open your journal to record exactly what transpired
    tonight.
  - Your mind brimming with new possibilities, you step inside and head upstairs.
    Slowly, you get undressed and open your journal to record exactly what transpired

  - "You\u2019re surprised by the carriage coming to a stop. You were so lost in dialogue
    that you hadn\u2019t even realized that you managed to make it home. Before the
    coachman can even hop off of his box, Corporal Dumas opens the door and steps
    down. He offers you his hand.\r"
  - "He helps you down effortlessly and favors you with a theatrical bow. \u201CAfter
    braving all manners of danger, we have arrived at your home, safe and sound. The
    Queen\u2019s Dragoons are proud to add another great victory to their name.\u201D "
  - "\u201CAnd while we accept no payment, I must ask of you a favor, madame.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThe next time that we meet, please call me Thomas-Alexandre,\u201D He pauses
    to stare into your eyes, \u201COr simply Alex if you like.\u201D\r"

    into the night.


    You turn to your home and see that Camille is already there, holding the door
    open for you.'
