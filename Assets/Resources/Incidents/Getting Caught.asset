  _nodeText:
  - You pause to read the social pages of the newspaper while you take your breakfast,
    sitting at your vanity. One of the benefits of working for Pierre is getting a
    free newspaper everyday.
  - "It's then that you nearly spit said breakfast all over your mirror when you read
    the social pages more closely. Paying attention to key details, you realize that
    the stories Pierre wrote using your gossip could be traced back to you. \n\nIf
    you can do it, there's a good chance that someone else can too."
  - (You have gained a decent amount of peril)
  - This, of course, will not do great things for your reputation.
  - (You have lost a decent amount of credibility)
  - You put down the newspaper and sigh. With that, your day has only begun.
