  _nodeText:
  - You stroll about the party taking in the atmosphere. It's boisterous, lively and
    bohemian.
  - On the other side of the room, you spot that intense young man from before. In
    fact, he's looking especially tense in his conversation with another guest. They've
    raised their voices and have already attracted a crowd.
  - '"No, you don''t understand! How can you be so caught up on civility and due process
    when our own people are suffering this very instant."'
  - '"The second we lose order, everything breaks down." The man replies, as if he
    were talking to a child. "If we make our case correctly in the General Assembly,
    we can convince the King that it''s in everyone''s best interests to adopt a constitutional
    monarchy. It worked in England, and it can work here."'
  - '"You really think you can just vote our problems away? If you play by the nobility''s
    rules, you''ll only get an order that they want. The name of our governance will
    change, but nothing will improve for anyone."'
  - '"What you want is simply not how things are done in a civilized country. I''m
    a lawyer with a wealth of experience, I know what I''m talking about. As far as
    I can tell, you''re what? A half-succesful playwright? What do you know?"'
  - '"I know that one does not make revolutions by half measures."'
  - Emboldened, Antoine steps closer to his opponent. "You'll see. Soon, the Crown
    will reveal its true colors. Soon, they'll show just how afraid of the people
    they really are. Soon, blood will need to be shed and you'll see how right I am."
  - Antoine turns to you, surprised. "Really? You're really going to agree with this
    tepid nonsense?"
  - Still in the throes of bubbling anger, Antoine shoots you a vicious glare.
  - Slowly, his face softens, and he sighs.
  - '"Are you mad? I''m not backing down from this patronizing miscreant. Not now,
    and not ever!"'
  - (You've lost some favor with Antoine)
  - (You've gained some favor with Antoine)
  - The crowd disperses, muttering agreeably amongst themselves. However, the constitutionalist
    remains, staying just to glare fixedly at you.
  - With a sigh of disgust, Antoine storms away from the conversation. You follow
    after him, but can't help but notice that nobody else attempts to join you.
  - He grumbles to himself for a while before looking at you. "What is it?"
  - '"People like you are a danger. Not just to the Crown, but to everyone." He hisses
    at you.'
  - (You've gained some peril)
  - With that, he departs, leaving you and Antoine together.
  - '"Thank you for your help. I was very close to losing my temper."'
  - '"If it pleases you, then yes, I will walk with you."'
  - (You've gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - '(You''ve lost a little favor with Antoine)

    (You''ve lost a little credibility)'
  - The two continue to 'debate' each other, but it quickly turns into yet another
    squabbling argument. Like all arguments, it simply goes in circles, with no actual
    resolution in sight.
  - The crowd murmurs in approval, appreciative of your ability to restore some calm
    to the situation.
  - (You have lost a little peril)
  - As this argument runs its course, the crowd slowly disperses, leaving the two
    of you alone together.
  - Slowly, the crowd disperses, leaving the two of you alone together.
  - He shoots one last dagger-like glare at his opponent. "This isn't over. It's not
    over at all."
  - '"Of course that''s how I feel!" He snarls at you. "Have you been paying any attention
    to what''s been going on?"'
  - He scowls at your question. "Really? That's what you gleaned from that entire
    conversation? That I've written a few plays?"
  - 'He pauses, considering his answer carefully and quickly while he examines your
    expression. "I have less to lose than they do. They deny the truth of what needs
    to be done, because most of them are still in positions of wealth, government,
    or cultural power." '
  - (You have lost a little favor with Antoine)
  - He stops, frowns, shakes his head as if to clear it, but frowns again.
  - '"We all view the world through panes of glass tinted by our own experiences.
    The truth is always obscured from us in some way. Yet, if you give someone an
    idea wrapped in fiction, they''re willing to set down that glass, because they
    don''t think what your saying is real."'
  - He sneers at the now distant crowd. "They want liberty and equality, as long as
    they get to keep all the things that make them powerful and secure. I have no
    such obstacles."
  - '"I''m surprised that you asked me at all. Most just write me off as a zealot.
    I think that delusion makes them comfortable." He shrugs before he smiles to you.
    "I like that you''re willing to be braver than that."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - '"I simply can''t stand it. How they all just choose passivity?"'
  - '"I know you''re right, but I''ll be damned if I ever stop hating it. These are
    the very people who have the the ability to make the greatest changes. Instead
    they''re content to beg for table scraps from the powerful and call it progress."'
  - He frowns, then smirks, then smiles. "Perhaps you're right."
  - '"If I ignore the real problems, I''ll be just as useless as that lot. I''ll be
    just another beast waiting to be led, content to beg for table scraps from the
    powerful and call it progress."'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - The two of you chat together for a little while longer, isolated from the crowd.
  - He smiles intently and says "Wait just a moment. I have something for you."
  - You notice that he's started to shift unsteadily on his feet, as if something
    is agitating him. Suddenly, he cuts the conversation short with a curt upward
    nod. "I must go, Madame. There is something pressing for me to take care of."
  - Before you can reply, he turns quickly on his heel and leaves. While you're puzzling
    over what's just transpired, you notice a white handkerchief fell out of his pocket
    and onto the floor. You pick it up, and are thankful to find that it hasn't been
    used.
  - '(You have gained a little favor with Antoine)

    (You can now go on rendezvous with Antoine)'
  - '"With fiction, we can show people the truth in ways that even the best rhetoric
    can never accomplish. We can convince them to see the truth themselves."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - He sighs. "It's true. I originally studied oratory and law, but my real passion
    in school was poetry and theater. There's just something special about fiction,
    myths, and legends."
  - However, you do notice that an address has been embroidered into it, in red thread.
    It might be very useful if you wanted to write him, or perhaps meet up with Antoine
    in the future.
  - (You can now go on rendezvous with Antoine)
  - Alone, you look down at the handkerchief in your hand.
  - Swept up in a heady rush of emotion, you float about the party, searching for
    your next engagement.
  - You do your best to maintain a low profile while you search for you next engagement
    at the party. Associating with someone like that may be necessary, but it rarely
    attracts the right sort of attention.
  - He pulls a clean, white handkerchief from his pocket and hands it to you. His
    name and address have been embroidered into it in red thread.
  - '"You should write me soon. I''d love to meet you alone, where we can be away
    from all these half-hearted types." He whispers, gesturing dismissively at some
    of the other guests.'
  - With that, he turns and leaves, disappearing almost instantly into the crowd.
  - '"To prioritize one''s own comfort like this... it''s so selfish. Are we no better
    than beasts?"'
  - '"I have plenty of allies here, even if they aren''t always vocal."'
  - He takes your hand in his own. "Though some are certainly smarter than others."
