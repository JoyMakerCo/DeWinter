  _nodeText:
  - For the last few weeks, discussions at the Estates General have been dragging
    out and growing ever more divisive.
  - Enraged by their unfair representation, representatives of the third estate have
    created their own body called 'The National Assembly', and invited members of
    the other estates to join them in negotiations on what would, in theory, be fairer
    ground.
  - However, His Majesty, King Louis XVI has yet to issue any official statement on
    the National Assembly. Reports suggest that he has instead chosen to spend the
    last few days in long meetings with the courtiers of his privy council, trying
    to reach a decision.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - 'This is, of course, in direct conflict with the orders of the King, who determined
    the voting system used in the Estates General. The nobility in the first estate
    have called on the Crown to issue a swift and decisive condemnation of this rebelious
    act. '
