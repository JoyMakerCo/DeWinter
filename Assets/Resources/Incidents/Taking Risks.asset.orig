  - As you walk around the party, sipping your wine, you notice Antoine is walking
    directly towards you. He look concerned.
  - He gently takes you by the elbow and leads you to a corner of the room, away from
    everyone else.
  - '"Yvette, something dire has happened, and there is something I will need you
    to do." He says in a low voice.'
  - '"<i>Fantastique</i>!" He replies with a wolfish grin. '
  - He pauses to glower at you. "Fine, let me explain the problem first."
  - He sighs and nods. "Your caution is understandable."
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - '"Do you remember those posters we put up?"'
  - "\"While we may have gotten away unscathed, it appears that the printmaker who
    made the posters wasn't so lucky. One of his apprentices betrayed him to the archers,
    and now our friend is imprisoned in <i>Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes</i>, and awaiting
    a very one-sided trial.\""
  - '"Normally, I would do something myself, but I have reason to believe the archers
    have been told to keep an eye on me." He continues, eyeing certain guests at the
    party suspiciously.'
  - '"This man, Monsieur Clet, he has taken risks for us. It''s time for us to repay
    the favor."'
  - '"Can you try to help him?"'
  - '"I knew I could count on you."'
  - '"Really, that''s where you draw your line?" He asks, incredulous. "This man helped
    us. We should help him."'
  - (You have lost some favor with Antoine)
  - '"Ugh... if you can''t help then I''ll find someone who can."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - "He takes a few moments explaining where Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes is, and everything
    you'd need to know about the location. It used to be a fortress, but one half
    of it was converted into a prison, and the other half into a nunnery. Usually,
    it's used to hold criminals who the Crown consider a real threat, but doesn't
    want to abuse, yet."
  - With dismissive gesture, he turns from you and stalks away, back towards the other
    party guests.
  - '"I don''t exactly what you can do for him, but it will do great things for the
    Revolution if we can show people that we defend those who aid us."'
  - He bends low and kisses the back of your hand. "I'm sorry, but I should step away,
    before anyone gets suspicious. We have to keep this secret, for now."
  - With that, he turns from you and strolls away, towards the other party guests.
  - "(<i>Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes</i> is now available to visit in the Paris map)"
