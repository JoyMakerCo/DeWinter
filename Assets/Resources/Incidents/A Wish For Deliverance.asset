    - Text: Once you get him focused on the subject of fine pipe tobacco, he becomes
        truly invested in the conversation. You ask just enough questions to get him
        on a long tirade, and it drags his attention away from the door long enough
        for Monsieur Clet to slip away.

    - Text: Sensing that you're trying to butter him up, the guard rebukes you, and
        even follows it up with some curses and threats. Thankfully, the time he spends
        yelling at you isn't spent looking at the door. This provides just enough
        time for Monsieur Clet to slip away.

        to the state of your virtue, which feels somewhat contradictory.

  _nodeText:
  - "It's a long walk to <i>Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes</i>, and you pass the time by
    reviewing your task again. You're here to free Monsieur Clet, a printmaker sympathetic
    to the revolution."
  - "You spot <i>Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes</i> just up ahead, and consider your next
    move."
  - "You spot <i>Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes</i> just up ahead, and consider your next
    move."
  - You head to the left side, where you find the entrance to the prison. The door
    is guarded by a single guard, who seems more occupied with smoking his pipe than
    with vigilance.
  - You go around the right side and examine the nunnery. It's peaceful and clean,
    but sparse in terms of any ornamentation. You spot a small group of nuns walking
    and talking together, but they keep their distance from you.
  - You giggle at the memory of all the times your angry parents threatened to send
    you to a nunnery for some mischeif you'd wrought in town. Looking around, you
    can't help but wonder how many women here are actually here because they want
    to be here, and how many were enrolled by force.
  - A woman who spent her life devoted to the Lord, and another one put there by her
    fed-up family. Surely, God would know the difference between the two, right?
  - '"Can I help you, madame?" He asks, not even taking the pipe out of his mouth.'
  - '"What? I''ve not heard about any of this!" He says, putting down his pipe. "Who
    agreed to this? I need a signed letter from the warden, first!"


    You put on your best innocent face, and start to force tears into your eyes.'
  - '"<i>Oui</i> madame, that is next door." He replies, then points with his thumb
    at the heavy prison door behind him. "This place here holds a less godly type
    of soul."'
  - '"Same amount of prayers for deliverance, though!" He laughs. "Though, I think
    the Lord is only heeding the prayers coming from next door."'
  - You thank the guard for his time, and follow his directions to the nunnery next
    door.
  - Just as you appear to be on the verge of a hysterical breakdown, the guard sighs
    and relents. It's not your proudest moment, but you can't argue with results.
  - He examines your fake tears, then narrows his eyes. "Madame, you need to leave.
    Right now."
  - You turn to leave, and carefully begin to walk away.
  - '"Now!" He screams, and you start leaving faster.'
  - '(You have lost quite a bit of of credibility)

    (You have gained quite a bit of peril)'
  - You run from him until you're out of sight, and nearly out of breath.
  - (You have lost some credibility... but it's probably worth it)
  - '"Fine... fine... I''ll let you in for a few minutes to see your brother." He
    sighs, looking around to make sure that none of his superiors are watching.'
  - You compose yourself, and weigh your options.
  - "With a bitter sigh, you turn away from the Ch\xE2teau de Vincennes and start
    to head home."
  - Monsieur Clet's situation is terrible, but you simply don't have the ability to
    do anything about it. He's on his own now.
  - Dabbing a few droplets of sweat from your brow, you curse the heat, and the almost
    suspiciously sunny weather. You consider putting up your hood, but decide it would
    make you stand out too much.
  - The thick, concealing garments could come in handy...
  - You breathe deeply as you step inside, savoring the cool air of the stone building.
    Unfortunately, it smells like stagnant water, musty old hay, and desperation.
  - Spotting no other guards in the area, you start searching the cells for a man
    matching the description of Monsieur Clet that Antoine gave you.
  - Wandering the darkened halls of the prison, you suddenly come face-to-face with
    Ludovico.
  - After a while, you manage to find Monsieur Clet. He looks thin and bedraggled.
    Also his clothes have obviously not been changed in days. You use a nearby ring
    of keys to let yourself into his cell.
  - '"Yvette? Is that you?" He whispers to you, frantically. "What are you doing here?"'
  - You look around, grab the garments, and quickly put one on over your regular clothes.
    Once you've finished donning the heavy and stifling outfit, you find yourself
    cursing the fates that led to you doing all of this on a hot day. You fold up
    the other habit and stash it in your bag.
  - He scrutinizes you further "However, I am warning you! I will not tolerate any
    tricks or lies here."
  - You giggle at the memory of all the times your angry parents threatened to send
    you to a nunnery for some mischeif you'd wrought in town. Looking around, you
    can't help but wonder how many women here are actually here because they want
    to be here, and how many were enrolled by force.
  - A woman who spent her life devoted to the Lord, and another one put there by her
    fed-up family. Surely, God would know the difference between the two, right?
  - The thick, concealing garments could come in handy...
  - With your disguise complete, you quickly flee the scene. You're sure it won't
    be long before someone notices the missing clothes, but you plan on being done
    before then.
  - Prepared as you are, you decide to head to the prison and try your luck there.
    The gate is protected by a single guard, who is fiddling with his pipe and tobacco.
  - '"Who are you? What are you doing here?" He hisses to you between his teeth.'
  - '"Who are you? What are you doing here?" He hisses to you between his teeth.'
  - '"Are you serious?" He asks, some of his vigor returning to him in a wave of excitement.
    "I knew I could count on you!"


    He quickly puts on your cloak and brings up the hood to hide his face.'
  - Taken aback, Monsieur Clet starts to object, but thinks better of it and instead
    puts on your cloak, and pulls up the hood to better hide his face.
  - '"Frankly? Yes. I find that very hard to believe. What are you thinking?"'
  - The lone guard looks up at you, then politely averts his eyes. \"Sister, what
    are you doing here?"
  - '"You''re here to..." He replies, thinking about your false purpose."'
  - You weigh your options and decide that the fates are against you. Before the guard
    can ask any further questions, you turn on your heel and hurry away. Once you're
    out of sight, you dispose of your disguise in a bush.
  - '"Oh, but of course, sister!" He exclaims, before he fumbles for his keys, then
    lets you in. "God be with you."'
  - You snap out of your religious pontification to search the area for something
    useful. Going around a corner, you notice an unattended washing line with a few
    nun habits, that have just finished drying in the sun.

    Also his clothes have obviously not been changed in days. You use a nearby ring
    of keys to let yourself into his cell.
  - With his disguise ready, you lead him out of the cell, and he falls into step
    behind you, staring at the ground in some effort to be less noticeable.
  - '"No... that can''t be right." The guard says to himself, angirly shaking his
    head. "You''re no nun at all! Who the devil are you?"'
  - '(You have gained some peril)

    (You have lost some credibility)'
  - Realizing that fortune has turned completely against you, you turn on your heel
    and run away. Thankfully, the guard's love of fine tobacco causes him to run out
    of breath far before you do, and he gives up the chase. Once you're out of sight,
    you dispose of your disguise in a bush.
  - '"Yvette? Is that you?" He whispers to you, frantically. "What are you doing here?"'
  - '"...and why are you dressed as a nun?"'
  - '"Sister? What are you doing here?" He asks weakly.'
  - "\"Are you serious?\" He asks, some of his vigor returning to him in a wave of
    excitement. \"I knew I could count on you!\" \n\nHe quickly puts on the spare
    habit that you kept in your bag."
  - Taken aback, Monsieur Clet starts to object, but thinks better of it and instead
    puts on the spare habit you kept in your bag.
  - '"Please, I wouldn''t dream of it." Ludovico replies with a smile.'
  - '"Frankly? Yes. I find that very hard to believe. What are you thinking?"'
  - "\"Administering to the souls of the condemned.\" He says, gesturing to the doors
    of the surrounding jail cells. \n\n\"Someone has to care for their spiritual well-being,
    and I suppose it might as well be me.\""
  - (You have lost a little favor with Ludovico)
  - With his disguise ready, you lead him out of the cell, and he falls into step
    behind you, staring at the ground with something that resembles a pious look of
    contemplation.
  - You realize that he makes for a particularly ugly nun, but hopefully it's still
    within the realm of beleivability.
  - You head outside, and have to pause for a moment, as you're nearly blinded by
    the bright light of the midday sun. Off to the side, the guard stands up and gets
    ready to challenge you, and your mysterious new companion.
  - But, for some reason, decides against it. Instead he sits back down and continues
    to smoke his pipe.
  - Together, you and Moniseur Clet walk all of the way back to Paris, before stepping
    into an alleyway to get rid of your disguises.
  - '"Ah, the taste of the open air has never been so good! Thank you so much Madame,
    I still can''t believe my good fortune!"'
  - '"Actually, I don''t want to know." He says throwing up his hands. However, I
    still don''t want you to get arrested doing whatever this is. So, I''m going to
    go and make sure the guard outside doesn''t become too suspicious."'
  - With that, he walks away to check in with the guard at the entrance of the prison.
  - '(You have gained a little credibility)

    (You have lost some peril)'
  - Uttering a quiet prayer of thanks for your good fortune, you resume your search
    for Monsiuer Clet.
  - '"Hmm... I should find somewhere to lay low for a whie. Maybe somewhere outside
    the city."'
  - '"So yes, I have a reason to be here. What about you Yvette? What''s this about?"'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - '"In fact, I''ll go outside and make sure the guard doesn''t find anything about
    your story to be suspicious. There''s glory in martyrdom, but that''s not a reason
    to avoid being careful."'
  - '"From where I''m standing, your cause seems entirely Christian and just. In fact,
    I wish that the Lord will be with you in your endeavors."'
  - The two of you exchange mutual well-wishes and part ways. The allies of the revolution
    are safe once more, thanks to your clever planning.
  - With a solemn grunt, the two of you part ways. The allies of the revolution are
    safe once more, thanks to your clever planning. Hopefully, this won't come back
    to bite you.
  - '"Administering to the souls of the condemned." He says, gesturing to the doors
    of the surrounding jail cells. "Someone has to care for their spiritual well-being,
    and I suppose it might as well be me."'
  - '"So yes, I have a reason to be here. What about you Yvette? What''s this about?"'

    still don''t want you to get arrested doing whatever this is. So, I''m going to
    go and make sure the guard outside doesn''t become too suspicious."'
  - Any disguise can be foiled with enough inspection, and you know that Monsieur
    Clet's would only last for a few seconds. Right now, you'd be lucky for people
    to just assume he was some kind of beggar, and ignore him.
  - You pause at the door leading outside, and consider how you'll distract the guard.
  - You step outside, and quickly engage the guard in as much pleasant, but meaningless
    conversation as you can. It's not about specifics, but about trying to get him
    invested enough that he keeps looking at you, but not at the door that he's supposed
    to be guarding.
  - You rush outside, and in a blur of feigned hysterical rage, accuse the guard of
    every crime under the sun. It's not about believability, it's about leveling so
    many accusations against him that he'll never have time to deal with them all.
  - Once you get him focused on the subject of fine pipe tobacco, he becomes truly
    invested in the conversation. You ask just enough questions to get him on a long
    tirade, and it drags his attention away from the door long enough for Monsieur
    Clet to slip away.
  - Needless to say, he is very displeased by this, but it does drag his attention
    away from the door long enough for Monsieur Clet to slip away.
  - Sensing that you're trying to butter him up, the guard rebukes you, and even follows
    it up with some curses and threats. Thankfully, the time he spends yelling at
    you isn't spent looking at the door. This provides just enough time for Monsieur
    Clet to slip away.
  - (You have gained quite a bit of peril)
  - The moment Monsieur Clet is out of sight, you turn away from the guard and leave
    in a huff. The engraged jailer shouts some invectives after you as you walk away.
    Half of them are related to your appearance, the other half to the state of your
    virtue, which feels somewhat contradictory.
  - You catch up with the escapee and together, the two of you walk all of the way
    back to Paris, before stepping into an alleyway to get rid of your disguises.
  - '(You have lost a decent amount of credibility)

    (You have gained a decent amount of peril)'
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - The moment Monsieur Clet is out of sight, you thank the guard for his time, and
    hurry away.
  - The moment Monsieur Clet is out of sight, you mutter some insincere apologies
    to the guard, and hurry away.
