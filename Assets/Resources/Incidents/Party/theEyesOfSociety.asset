  _nodeText:
  - You wander around the party, scanning the room for someone interesting to talk
    to. You hear some shuffling behind you.
  - '"Guess who?" A sultry voice whispers in your ear.'
  - '"Mmm... a mere lucky guess." She replies, but you can hear the smile in her
    voice.'
  - '"Armand? Really?" The voice asks, as they drop their hands from your eyes.'
  - '"Ignoring my request? How disobedient." The low voice replies. "Now, guess who?"'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - '"I''m in a great mood, and I''d like to celebrate it with you. First, however,
    we''ll need to find somewhere quiet."'
  - She grabs you by the hand, and leads you away to a distant corner of the party.
  - Your progress through the crowds of the party is surprisingly slow. People keep
    stopping the two of you to pay their respects to Madame Gazel, and ask her for
    her opinion on various matters particular to the Bourgeoisie.
  - You also can't help but notice how many guests' eyes linger on the way she's
    holding your hand. Nobody says a word, but they do watch.
  - Finally, the two of you manage to find an empty room in the party, forgotten
    by the other guests. A low fire burns in the fireplace, but nobody is here. She
    slowly shuts the door behind you, and takes a seat in a big, overstuffed chair.
  - '"Sit." She commands, pointing to a spot on the floor in front of her.'
  - Careful to make sure that you don't step on your own dress, you sit on the floor
    in front of her, your legs curled off to one side and your body propped up on
    one hand. She looms over you, and she smiles.
  - Undaunted, you stride up to her, and in a smooth motion you sit on her lap. Surprised,
    she leans back and lets a wide grin blossom across her face. Her features flicker
    in the firelight.
  - Walking off to the side, you grab one of the chairs and drag it in front of her.
    Comfortably, you take a seat. All Madame Gazel can do is roll her eyes.
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - She entwines her fingers in the hair on the back of your head, and slowly but
    firmly, Madame Gazel pulls your face close to hers. "And I will always love instilling
    obedience in you."
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - The two of you engage in little snippets of conversation, all of them meaningless.
    Instead, the both of you are focused on each other. The entire party going on
    in the other rooms fades into the background as you slowly let go of yourself.
    Let yourself be made lesser than another. Let yourself be controlled.
  - The room goes dark as someone comes up behind you and places their hands over
    your eyes.
  - Turning yourself around, you find yourself face to face with none other than
    Madame Gazel. "In what world do I sound like Armand?"
  - '"Fortunately for you, I''m already in a great mood, and I''d like to celebrate
    it with you. First, however, we''ll need to find somewhere quiet."'
  - She drops her hands from your eyes and you turn around to find yourself face
    to face with none other but Madame Gazel.
  - '"Oh, you ever remain full of surprises."'
  - Suddenly, your spine goes stiff at the sound of the door opening. A woman walks
    into the room, and the both of you go as still as statues.
  - She looks disgusted by what she sees, but also completely unsurprised. As if
    she was looking for something.
  - '"What, exactly are the two of you doing?"'
  - After a pause, Madame Gazel agrees. "She's right. It's nothing at all."
  - The room goes silent, and even you are taken aback by the audacity of the woman
    who just said that. That is, until you remember that the woman who made that
    comment is you.
  - '"You fell?"'
  - She glares suspiciously at you and mumbles "Well, you do look rather flushed."
  - '"Oh don''t bother with those preposterous lies."'
  - Madame Gazel stands up her chair, still holding onto one of your hands. "It's
    true! My dear friend here is so clumsy. I just have no idea what she'd do without
    me."
  - '(You have lost some credibility)

    (You have gained some peril)'
  - She sneers at you both. "You disgusting people can't evade the eyes of society
    forever."
  - The two of you sit together in stony silence. Even the crackling of the fire
    seems muted.
  - This interloper seems surprised, yet also smugly satisfied. Like wielding this
    power is what fulfills her.
  - '"Good... I thought as much."'
  - With that, this person leaves as suddenly as they arrived. Yet, the pall they
    cast over the room remains. Madame Gazel sighs, and stares at the ceiling.
  - '"I know I said that I was in a great mood before, but this is... that was..."
    She trails off, never completing the sentence. She doesn''t need to.'
  - Suddenly, she stands up, the shine of tears just starting to well up in her eyes.
    "I'm sorry Yvette... I just need to.. I just-"
  - With that, Honorade leaves, and you are alone.
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel... Don't worry, it's not really
    your fault.)
  - You glance around the room. There's nothing here except a low fire, and a sense
    of heartache.
  - Alone, you just sit in the room by yourself for a while. You lose track of time
    as you relive every detail of what just transpired, over and over again. You
    can't help it. All you can do it relive the moments, picking apart the flaws
    of every exchange.
  - Unable to stand this indignity anymore, you stand up in a whirl of finery and
    fury. You rush out the door to find this interloper and tell her exactly what
    you think of her disgust.
  - Outwardly she looks calm, but she's squeezing your hand so hard that your fingers
    are starting to tingle.
  - '"I suppose that''s reasonable." She says, with a strange sense of disappointment
    about her.'
  - The suspicious woman leaves, glancing back at the two of you one last time before
    she disappears from your sight.
  - After a few moments, the two of you finally exhale in unison.
  - '"Well, that certainly got my heart racing." Madame Gazel giggles.'
  - '"W-well, this is disgusting. In fact, both of you are." The interloper replies
    with with venom, but far quieter than she intended. The lack of volume seems
    to rob her of the intended gravitas.'
  - '"You are at least partly correct." Honorade chimes in. "I too am absolutely
    disgusted."'
  - '"But you''re free to leave at any time."'
  - '"This isn''t over." She sneers at you both. "You people can''t evade the eyes
    of society forever."'
  - With that she leaves, and tries to slam the door on her way out. Unfortunately
    for her, the door gets caught on the carpet and just lazily drifts shut.
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - '"I must admit that I never expected you to be the one to defending me, Yvette.
    In fact, I never really expected anyone to defend me at all."'
  - (You have gained quite a bit of favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have lost a little credibility)
  - Taking the time to lock the door this time, the two of you resume your same positions
    as before, and spend some more time together, whispering meaningless nothings
    and drawing ever closer. The time slips away from the both of you.
  - '"You know that''s not what I meant."'
  - It's not a good feeling.
  - Realizing that you've already drawn your fair share of suspicion, the two of
    you eventually part ways. If nothing else, this has ensured that you've had a
    lovely evening.
  - You can't hear anything other than your own breathing and the blood flowing faster
    and faster through your veins. The anger is so overwhelming that it's become
    intoxicating.
  - Hurtling from room to room, you come upon her, merrily talking with other guests
    as if nothing had ever happened. As if she was innocent.
  - Words of purest venom issue forth from your mouth, with such speed and violence
    that you don't even remember what you said. What you do remember, is the looks
    on the faces of everyone who heard you say it.
  - '(You have gained quite a bit of peril)

    (You have gained quite a bit of
    credibility)'
  - The rest of the evening is a blur. You're not even sure if you did anything else
    at the party before you headed home. You spend a few hours trying to piece the
    events together in your journal.
  - '"Good girl."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Madame Gazel)
  - You can't even remember when the conversation stopped, but both of your wrists
    are in Madame Gazel's hands, and her lips are drifting so close to yours.
  - 'She''s not wrong. You can feel how red your cheeks are. '
  - Still, some part of this stranger remains unconvinced, which makes sense. Your
    lie was absolutely preposterous.
  - None of the other guests have any context for this display of fury. All they
    know is that you were willing to come to Madame Gazel's defense in a most spectacular
    fashion. Even if they don't approve of it, they do seem to respect it.
  - At some indeterminate point in the night, Therese appears, entering your room
    slowly.
  - Therese appears, entering the room slowly.
  - "Once Madame Gazel has faded from view, you find Th\xE9r\xE8se waiting at your
    elbow. \"It looks like even I have new things to learn, Madame Decaux.\" She
    chuckles to herself."
  - '"Then again, I''ve always found myself attracted to men who are wealthy in coin
    and impoverished in self-control. So, I suppose my experience has been limited."'
  - '"To my eyes, it''s clear that Madame Gazel trusts you very deeply, and cares
    for you equally so. However, she''s still a woman who naturally keeps to herself.
    As long as you maintain good standing with her, she should reach out to you in
    the future. Take whatever that special invitation is, and it will all work out."'
  - '"I don''t know what to say, madame. Some people are not motivated by a love
    or power, or coin. They simply want to hurt people, and make them small, so that
    they themselves might feel more significant."'
  - '"As poorly as things went, it seems clear to me that Madame Gazel trusts you
    very deeply, and cares for you equally so. However, she''s still a woman who
    naturally keeps to herself. As long as you maintain good standing with her, she
    should reach out to you in the future. Take whatever that special invitation
    is, and it will all work out."'
  - With that, she leaves the room and you are left to your own devices
  - '"It is not how things should be, but it is how they are."'
