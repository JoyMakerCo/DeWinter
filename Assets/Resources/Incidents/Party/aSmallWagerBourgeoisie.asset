  - Hearing an outburst of cheers, you wander into a small room to see what the fuss
    is all about.
  - Inside, you find a group of men clustered around a table with a roulette wheel
    set up on it. Their faces are a mixture of fear, disappointment and triumph,
    but they're all obviously excited. After the latest spin, some grumbling is heard
    and some coin is exchanged.
  - Looking up, a man approaches you. "Care to make a wager, madame?"
  - '"Ah, you are a woman after my own heart!" He laughs, ushering you through the
    crowd to see the table itself. Some of the other gamblers laugh with him, and
    shout words of encouragement to you.'
  - '"So, how much would you like to wager?"'
  - '"Are you sure madame? It''s quite exhilarating."'
  - '"Oh, for a first timer, it''s simple enough." He says, ushering you through
    the crowd to see the table itself. '
  - He smiles kindly he takes your money "A most prudent choice for a first time
    player, madame."
  - '"Fair indeed, madame!" He replies as he takes your money.'
  - His eyes twinkle like diamonds as he takes you money. "A bold choice, madame!"
  - '"Now, would you like to bet on red or black?"'
  - He places your coins on the outside betting track for red, and the dealer releases
    the ball into the spinning wheel.
  - He places your coins on the outside betting track for black, and the dealer releases
    the ball into the spinning wheel.
  - "As the ball starts to slow down, leaving the rim and drifting towards one of
    the pockets. Everyone around the roulette goes as still as a statue. \n\nThat's
    when you make your move."
  - '"Well, if you insist..." He replies, turning away from you. You can tell that
    the other gamblers in the room have also lost interest in your entirely.'
  - Slowly and carefully, you reach your hand towards your coins.
  - 'While everyone else is focused on the game, you focus on winning. Noticing that
    you''re about to lose, you deftly switch the placement of your wager to a different
    color. '
  - 'Just as you start to move your coins, you feel a hand clamp down on your wrist.
    "I would advise against that, madame." The man growls in your ear, low enough
    that only you can hear it. '
  - The ball spins frantically in the wheel. The gamblers go quiet, all watching
    the ball with such intensity, as if there was nothing else in the world.
  - The ball starts to slow down, leaving the rim and drifting towards one of the
    pockets. Everyone around the roulette goes as still as a statue.
  - The balls lands in your newly selected pocket and the gamblers erupt into a bevy
    of cheers and groans. The man glances down at your wager's placement with a note
    of confusion, but can't seem to find any fault. He hands you your winnings. "Congratulations,
    madame! It seems you have that beginner's luck!"
  - He discreetly points to the exit, and you silently excuse yourself from the game.
    You decide to investigate the rest of the party, and avoid all eye contact with
    that man in the foreseeable future.
  - The ball lands in a red pocket, and the gamblers erupt into a bevy of cheers
    and groans. The man excitedly pushes your winnings into your hands. "Congratulations,
    madame! It seems you have that beginner's luck!"
  - The ball lands in a black pocket, and the gamblers erupt into a bevy of cheers
    and groans. You sigh as your wager is dived up greedily amongst the other gamblers.
    The man pats the top of your hand sympathetically and says "I'm sorry madame,
    it appears that fortune wasn't in your favor."
  - 'Deciding that this is not your forte, you leave the gamblers to their games
    of chance and depart to the rest of the party. You would much rather play games
    of the heart, at least those involve skill. '
  - The ball lands in a black pocket, and the gamblers erupt into a bevy of cheers

    and shout words of encouragement to you.'
  - '"First you place a bet on either red or black. Then we spin the wheel and let
    the ball drop in. If the ball lands on the color you wagered, then you earn twice
    your wager! If the ball lands on the other color, then it''s better luck next
