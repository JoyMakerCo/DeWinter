  - You stroll between the tents in the field, examining all of the different groups
    sheltering from the sun. This is one of the few places where you can attend a
    party frequented by both commoners and the nobility, and still they instinctively
    filter themselves by rank. Nevertheless, every guest feels deeply connected with
    every other... except for you.
  - Your reconnaissance eventually leads you to a veteran standing by himself between
    the tents. He's standing alone, but doesn't seem particularly perturbed by this
    fact. He's wearing the ribbons of some kind of gallant or knightly order, but
    those badges honestly all look the same to you.
  - '"Ah, <i>salut madame</i>!" He says with a curious informality. "Don''t worry
    about feeling out of place, I rarely come to these things either. Unlike some
    of the souls here, I swore to myself that I wouldn''t let my time in the army
    be the most interesting thing that ever happened to me."'
  - '"Ah, I''m being dreadfully rude! Please, how are you enjoying yourself?"'
  - '"You truly want to know?"'
  - '"Quit the field? Your presumption seems only matched by your self regard."'
  - '"Really, you''ve spoken with no one else?"'
  - '"Surely you know it''s foolish to attend a party if you have no intent on approaching
    the other guests." He says, barely attempting to conceal his patronizing tone.'
  - '"Do I look like some sort of social pariah to you? Is this a cruel jape being
    played by the other guests?" He asks angrily, scanning the crowd for onlookers. '
  - '"I don''t know what drives such ghoulish curiosity, but if you really seek this
    prize, I won''t deny you."'
  - '"No, I shan''t repeat it, and the fact that you want to know more about such
    dreadful things only cements my decision."'
  - '(You have lost a decent amount of credibility)

    (You have gained a little
    peril)'
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Military Gossip)
  - With the details of the rumor firmly secured, you divert the conversation to
    some relatively tame but still interesting stories. Enough to be daring, but
    not upsetting.
  - Just as the conversation starts to slow, you find a way to retreat, without arousing
    too much suspicion.
  - Before you can even attempt to change his mind, he marches away, and you are
    left to look for some new other target to approach.
  - (You have gained a decent amount of peril)
  - '"However, it can never be said that I was one to shrink from a challenge. Perhaps
    this will be enough to still your insolent tongue."'
  - He outlines the rumor to you, putting a strong emphasis on the elements that
    make it so disagreeable. Presumably, this is part of some misplaced strategy
    to cow you, but really it just gives you exactly what you want.
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Military Gossip)
  - '"I think this conversation is over." He says, already turning smartly on his
    heel. "Good day."'
  - With that, he leaves, wrongly thinking himself the victor in your confrontation.
    Satisfied, you search the field for other battles.
  - (You have lost a little credibility)
  - '"Still, if you haven''t spoken with anyone else, I suppose there''s nothing
    dangerous in telling you what''s been bothering me about these rumors."'
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Military Gossip)
  - '"Though, every time I return, I seem to overhear things salacious enough to
    remind me why I stay away..."'

  - '"What''s so awful that it could drive a gallant man like you away?"'
  - '"You''ve quit the field over a few unseemly rumors? Whatever could they be?"'
  - '"I don''t really know. I haven''t talking to anyone else, and I just feel lost."'
