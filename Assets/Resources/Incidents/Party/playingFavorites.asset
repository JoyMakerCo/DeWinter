  _nodeText:
  - The party is winding down. You're slightly tipsy, a little disheveled, and your
    feet ache, but you think you've conducted yourself about as well as you could,
    tonight. You can hear some of other guests grumbling angrily about something,
    but it doesn't really concern you.
  - A young man approaches you and manages to stutter "Ma-madame, your friend is
    drunk."
  - He sighs, visibly relieved that he no longer needs to be responsible for this.
    He points to the back of the vestibule that you're occupying. "<i>Merci</i>,
    your friend Madame Le Brun, is over there. She said that you'd help her get home."
  - Eyes glancing from side to side, the man stammers "Uh, you are Y-Yvette Decaux,
    <i>non</i>?"
  - '"Madame Le Brun, she''s quite drunk and said that you''d help her get home."'
  - "He leads you to \xC9lisabeth, who's pretending to lean casually against a table,
    but obviously needs the support. She brightens up when she sees you, but you
    can hear the other guests grumble and whisper, their anger transferring onto
    you as well."
  - '"Madame Le Brun, pointed you out to me, and said that you''d help her get home."
    He gestures discreetly to some of the frowning faces in the vestibule. "Your
    friend''s made a bit of scene, so we feel it would be for the best if she left."'
  - He sighs, visibly relieved that he no longer needs to be responsible for this.
    He points to the back of the vestibule that you're occupying. "<i>Merci</i>,
    your friend is over there."
  - In a swift and imperious motion, you turn your back on the man, and simply leave.
    Nobody tries to stop you, as you have every right to decide what to do with yourself.
    However, that doesn't stop a few of them from staring at you, with mouths agape.
  - 'The carriage ride home is sharp and fast, your conveyance flying through the
    night, bouncing over the cobble stones. '
  - You retire to your bedroom and wordlessly undress before sitting down to write
    in your journal. You've worked too hard so far to waste your time, and risk your
    neck getting caught up in other people's mistakes.
  - "Once you start walking, \xC9lisabeth's bright demeanor disappears. She goes
    quiet, staring off into the distance and fiddling with her handkerchief. It takes
    a few minutes before she speaks."
  - "\"My feet hurt, so let's take the carriage!\" \xC9lisabeth exclaims, a little
    too loudly."
  - In the carriage, her bright demeanor disappears and she goes quiet, staring at
    the floor and fiddling with her handkerchief. It takes a few minutes before she
    speaks.
  - '"Someone said something... I slapped him. I might have also spilled his drink."'
  - '"Someone said something... I slapped him. I might have also spilled his drink."'
  - She sighs shakily and sneers for a second at the thought of it. "I've probably
    drank a little too much wine, and I was talking to a client. This stranger interrupted
    me to provide some 'insight'."
  - She sighs shakily and sneers for a second at the thought of it. "I've probably
    drank a little too much wine, and I was talking to a client. This stranger interrupted
    me to provide some 'insight'."
  - She manages to give you a weak smile. "He did."
  - '"Since always!" She screams "It''s always hurt!"'
  - Her voice is suddenly small again, barely above a whisper. "Why wouldn't it?"
  - '"It''s just that..." She stares down at the handkerchief again, collecting her
    thoughts before she says. "It encourages them, they''re like dogs chasing a rat.
    They want to hear you squeak, it lets them feel powerful."'
  - '"He said that my self portraits were a sign of narcissism. He also said that
    the only reason I put my daughter in them is because I was using her as a shield
    from criticism."'
  - '"So yes, I slapped him. I put my hand through his drink and into his face."'
  - '"I''ve ignored my detractors for years. I''ve never lost my temper, hoping that
    they''d move onto something else." She pauses to curse under her breath.'
  - '"It felt amazing. Vindicating."'
  - '"And to make it worse, I''m about to do it again."'
  - She shrugs. "It's true, I could always be hated and poor."
  - '"I''ve been told that Princess Maria of Austria is interested in commissioning
    me, but no matter how many letters I write to her estate, I can''t get a response.
    This could be a huge opportunity for me, and for some reason I can''t get a simple
    letter past her staff."'
  - '"Still, I will always appreciate earnest compliments."'
  - '"<i>Salut</i> Yvette! Do you want to leave as much as I do?"'
  - '"I''m not even a person to them, I''m a symbol. The scheming climber who only
    got her position through royal patronage."'
  - '"However... Princess Maria of Austria is Marie Antoinette''s sister."'
  - She manages to give you a weak smile. "He did."
  - '"Since always!" She screams "It''s always hurt!"'
  - That gets a real laugh out of her. "I'm pretty sure if I told you, he'd be dead
    by now."
  - '"I know that." She stares down at the handkerchief again, collecting her thoughts
    before she says. "It encourages them, just like dogs chasing a rat. They want
    to hear you squeak, it lets them feel powerful.'
  - '"I''m not joking, you''re a scary woman, you know that?"'
  - '"He said that my self portraits were a sign of narcissism. He also said that
    the only reason I put my daughter in them is because I was using her as a shield
    from criticism."'
  - '"So yes, I slapped him. I put my hand through his drink and into his face."'

  - Her voice is suddenly small again, barely above a whisper. "Why wouldn't it?"
  - '"I''m not even a person to them, I''m a symbol. The scheming climber who only
    got her position through royal patronage."'
  - '"And to make it worse, I''m about to do it again."'
  - '"Still, I put a piece of myself into every one of my paintings. I just want
    them to be judged for what they are, not who made them."'
  - '"That''s the worst part. I know my work is good! I know it''s valuable."'
  - Elisabeth glares at the carriage floor. "No, it isn't."
  - Elisabeth nods along, grateful that you understand. "That's exactly it."
  - '"Marie and I have only just started talking again. I can''t just start asking
    her for things."'
  - "\xC9lisabeth lets out a long, shaky sigh. \"You're right. If I want to stop
    feeling guilty, then I have to make sacrifices.\""
  - '"What?"'
  - "\xC9lisabeth turns to you, with wide eyes. \"You're absolutely right! Versailles
    is crawling with courtiers, and nobody looks down on them. If they can ask a
    simple favor, why can't I? At least I'm actually Marie's friend.\""
  - "\xC9lisabeth turns to you, with an expression of confusion and disgust. \"Yes
    Yvette, Versailles is crawling with such people. They're all terrible parasites.
    Why would I want to end up like them?\""
  - '"Thanks, Yvette. I was just so caught up in success that I wasn''t thinking
    about what''s important."'
  - 'You fall silent, and think to yourself for a while. Monarchy depends on displays
    of power to survive. Every piece of art glorifying a monarch grants power, not
    only to them, and but to the idea of kings and queens itself. '
  - "While \xC9lisabeth starts planning her next move, you grow silent, and think
    to yourself for a while. Monarchy depends on displays of power to survive. Every
    piece of art glorifying a monarch grants power, not only to them, and but to
    the idea of kings and queens itself. "
  - 'You grow silent, and think to yourself for a while. Monarchy depends on displays
    of power to survive. Every piece of art glorifying a monarch grants power, not
    only to them, and but to the idea of kings and queens itself. '
  - 'You''re shaken from your thoughts by the lurching feeling of your carriage rolling
    to a stop. Looking out the windows you see that you''ve arrived at Elisabeth''s
    house. '
  - "\"Thanks for your help Yvette!\" \xC9lisabeth says, obviously feeling better
    than before."
  - "\"Oh, I definitely will.\" \xC9lisabeth replies with a devious smile."
  - "\"Don't worry, I won't.\" \xC9lisabeth says, rolling her eyes, but barely concealing
    a smile."
  - She steps down from your carriage into the street, and with a signal to your
    coachman, you take off into the night.
  - Without Marie Antoinette using her influence to get her way, and without Princess
    Maria having a great portrait to glorify her, the legitimacy of kings and queens
    atrophies, just a little.
  - Without Marie Antoinette using her influence to get her way, and without Princess
    Maria having a great portrait to glorify her, the legitimacy of kings and queens
    atrophies, just a little.
  - She frowns and sighs. "I'll just avoid painting that portrait altogether."
  - When Marie Antoinette uses her influence to get her way, she shows that she's
    relevant. When Elisabeth paints Princess Maria, she'll have new art to glorify
    her. With this, the legitimacy of kings and queens grows, just a little.
  - Out on the street, you wave to your coachman to head home without you. Given
    what happened the last time he went home without you, he seems reluctant, but
    does as he's told.
  - She shrugs. "It's true, I could always be hated and poor."
  - '"That''s the worst part. I know my work is good! I know it''s valuable."'
  - '"I''ve been told that Princess Maria of Austria is interested in commissioning
    me, but no matter how many letters I write to her estate, I can''t get a response.

    Maria having a great portrait to glorify her, the legitimacy of kings and queens
    atrophies, just a little.
  - (The Crown has lost some power)
  - "You're shaken from your thoughts when you notice that \xC9lisabeth has stopped
    walking. Looking around, you realize that you've already arrived at her house."
  - 'While she starts planning her next move, you fall silent, and think to yourself
    for a while. Monarchy depends on displays of power to survive. Every piece of

  - "\"Don't worry, I won't.\" \xC9lisabeth says, rolling her eyes, but barely concealing
    a smile."
  - She quietly opens the door, and heads inside her house. After waiting a few seconds
    to make sure that she's alright, you take off into the night.
  - You say your last goodbyes in the vestibule, and get ready to leave.
  - "(You have lost a decent amount of favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(You have lost some
    Credibility)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - '"Now, it''s beyond that. Hating me isn''t even anger anymore, it''s just part
    of proving that you''re an important lover of the arts, someone with taste."'
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have lost some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"

  - "Back home, your spymistress Th\xE9r\xE8se is waiting for you outside. You're
    not sure if it's your imagination, but you thought you saw her talking to someone
    in the shadows before she turns to you."
  - '"It''s come to my attention that you escorted Madame Le Brun home from that
    party after she had some... difficulties. I never took you for a knight in shining
    armor, but I''m glad to see you''re still full of surprises."'
  - '"You''re doing very well, indeed. At this rate, if you manage to stay on her
    good side, she''ll likely call upon you again soon. Just be patient." She chuckles
    to herself. "In fact, if the Crown prevails in whatever conflagration comes next,
    your relationship with Madame Le Brun could be your key to a comfortable future."'
  - Lost in thoughts of future dalliances and schemes, you head inside to prepare
    for bed. All the while, the events of tonight repeat themselves in your mind.
    Carefully, you take out your diary, and begin to write.
  - '"Of course, if the Crown falls, it could be a dangerous liability. I trust you''ll
    make the appropriate decisions, with that in mind."'
