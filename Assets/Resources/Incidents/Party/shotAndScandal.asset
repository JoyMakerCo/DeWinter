  - You circle the party with a wide-eyed expression of feigned delight. It's not
    that you're not enjoying yourself, but it helps make it less noticeable that
    you're looking for promising targets of your inquiries.
  - You come across a conversation between Stephane de Fer, that naval architect
    you met earlier, and Corporal d'Auvergne. Stephane is keeping a calm demeanor,
    but the young cavalryman is letting his fiery temperament get the best of him.
  - Why is that smaller people are always so quick to anger? Do they just have the
    same amount of choler as everyone else, but less room to store it?
  - '"First it''s excuses and pay shortages, but now we''re dogged by yet another
    scandal. Even our weapons themselves are suspect."'
  - You come across a conversation between a bespectacled man and Corporal d'Auvergne.
    The unfamiliar guest is keeping a calm demeanor, but the young cavalryman is
    letting his fiery temperament get the best of him.
  - '"So I''ve heard." Replies the gentleman. "From what I know, soldiers in multiple
    battalions have found that they were sold crates of musket balls made from doctored
    lead. These brittle ammunitions barely fly through the air. Even if they do manage
    to find their mark, they harmlessly crumble to dust."'
  - '"Ugh!" The dragoon replies, spitting on the ground in disgust. "If any of us
    did this, we''d swing from the gallows, and rightly so! It seems that even treason
    in the name of profit is acceptable, as long as you have blue blood flowing through
    your veins!"'
  - Whose fault is this, really? You consider the implications of such a rumor.
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Crown Gossip)
  - (You have gained a piece of Shocking Military Gossip)
  - '"The entire thing is a disaster, from start to finish." The gentleman shakes
    his head at the thought.'
  - '"<i>Merde</i>!" Curses the Dragoon when he sees that you''ve overheard their
    conversation.'
  - '"Obviously, I find no fault with His Majesty King Louis XVI, God preserve him!
    The Military stands ready to defend him at a moment''s notice!" The Corporal
    exclaims, forcing an excessively broad smile.'
  - '"Of course, none of this is the fault of His Majesty King Louis XVI." He says
    with a suddenly forced smile. "The Military is merely... concerned about how
    certain courtiers above those who defend the nation."'
  - '"Believing otherwise would be an unacceptable crime, and beneath me."'
  - '"She''s quite right, you know." Stephane says with a nod in your direction.
    "If His Majesty isn''t seeing to the best interests of his soldiers in potential
    matters of life or death, where can one expect him to do so?"'
  - '"She''s quite right, you know." Stephane says with a nod in your direction.
    "His Majesty must have his reasons."'
  - '"<i>Merci beaucoup</i>, madame." He replies, in a low voice.'
  - You come across a conversation between a bespectacled man and a dragoon. The
    unfamiliar guest is keeping a calm demeanor, but the young cavalryman is letting
    his fiery temperament get the best of him.
  - You come across a conversation between Stephane de Fer, that naval architect
    you met earlier, and a dragoon. Stephane is keeping a calm demeanor, but the
    young cavalryman is letting his fiery temperament get the best of him.
  - He grimaces before returning to his normally neutral expression. "It appears
    that the supplier of these musket balls is owned by a noble who's currently favored
    at court, so any investigations into this misdeed have merely... fizzled out,
    without answers."
  - (You have gained a piece of Shocking Crown Gossip)
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Military Gossip)
  - Well, that's not including the gossip you picked up earlier, but he believes
    you regardless.
  - '(You have gained a little credibility)

    (You have lost a little peril)'
  - '"Everything feels like it''s just lurching from one crisis to the other. People
    like us..." He continues, gesturing at the three of you. "... people like us
    need to look out for each other, because I guarantee you that nobody else will."'
  - '"I know she''s right, I''d just hoped it wasn''t the case." The corporal sighs.
    "At this rate, we need to look out for ourselves."'
  - '"Hmm..." Corporal d''Auvergne grunts. "That''s probably true."'
  - '"I can be unhappy with this state of affairs, while still having my loyalties,
    unlike some of the people here." The corporal sneers.'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - (The Military has moved towards the Revolution a little)
  - '"Well, perhaps we''re growing tired of risking our lives for those who clearly
    wouldn''t make the same sacrifice, were the situation reversed."'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - Slowly, that sneer fades to something else. Something more exhausted. "Then again,
    perhaps you're right, and I'd just hoped it wasn't the case. At this rate, his
    Majesty the King is our last, best hope."
  - (The Military has moved to the Crown a little)
  - (The Military has moved towards the Crown a little)
  - Your conversation with the two of them continues at a pleasant pace for some
    time afterwards. It's nice to actually relax at one of these events. If one isn't
    careful, they could start to feel like work, and what would the point of that
    be?
  - Slowly, that sneer fades to something else. Something more exhausted. "Then again,
    perhaps you're right, and I'd just hoped it wasn't the case. At this rate, we
    need to look out for ourselves."
  - (The Military has moved towards the Revolution a little)
  - Eventually, you say your goodbyes and part ways with them. You scan the party
    to see if there's anything else you can do before the party ends.
