      only to make the mistake of getting extremely drunk afterwards. A single chambermaid
      has been told to watch over him, but you\u2019ve never been one to let such

  _nodeText:
  - Taking another turn of the party, you come across a beleaguered chambermaid attempting
    to contain a guest who is clearly far too deep into his cups.
  - '"Ah, today is a grand day, is it not? I''ve been entru... been entru... I''ve
    been let in on such amazing things by our hosts. You''ll see. You''ll all see!
    Their trust in my discretion was not misplaced!"'
  - '"I''m sorry, monsieur, but I''m on strict orders from the lady of the house
    to ensure that you are not... overserved. I simply cannot get you another drink."'
  - '"Water, that base drink? It rusts steel! Water, for a man of my knowledge..."'
  - '"What is it? Well, it''s..." He stares off into space, squinting as if he was
    trying to read a book that had been placed very far away from him.'
  - 'Someone calls out to the chambermaid, and she looks behind her, towards some
    new disaster in the process of unfolding. In a panic, she leaves her charge while
    heading towards this latest problem. As she''s leaving, she calls out over her
    shoulder "Please monsieur, just stay here and find some water!" '
  - '"Ah yes, finally a young lady that understands!" He cheers, as you take him
    by the elbow and gently lead him away. Up close, you realize that several of
    his coat buttons have been buttoned into the wrong hole.'
  - '"Well, nobody asked you." The man replies, as if everyone in the entire building
    couldn''t hear him.'
  - '"Well, it''s very important really. Only just recently have the hosts brought
    me further into their circle of trust. I know they''re a touch unsure about my
    discretion, but they''ll soon see that I can keep this secret, among others."'
  - '"It''s a matter requiring great secrecy!" He says, glaring at you with all of
    the willpower that he can summon.'
  - It isn't long before you manage to get two glasses of brandy for yourselves,
    from a servant who clearly hasn't been informed of your new acquaintance's state
    yet.
  - Regardless, you leave him behind to attend to your own business. You have better
    things to do than play coy with a moronic drunk. Thankfully, some of the other
    guests seem to approve of your unwillingess to get involved with such antics.
  - Perhaps there's something else for you to do here.
  - (You have lost a little peril)
  - '"A toast!" He yells. "To the health of our hosts, and to new friends!"'
  - You take a deep sip of the brandy, and nearly cough it up. That is far stronger
    than you expected. You've also started to notice that more than a few guests
    are glaring at you.
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - As you ply the man with drink, you carefully maneuver him around the party, to
    make sure that the chambermaid never finds him while you go about your work.
    "Indeed, it's a night fit for celebration. Only just recently have the hosts
    brought me further into their circle of trust. In fact, you wouldn't believe
    the goings-on that I'm privy to..."
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Military Gossip)
  - '"... of course, I can never tell anyone about such affairs. It would truly be
    a disaster if such secrets came to light, you see?"'
  - Why in fact, you do see. You see quite well.
  - '"However, I must take my leave, madame. For some reason, I''ve been taken with
    a powerful urge to sit and rest for a while. "Goodnight!" '
  - 'You wave to him as he departs. If nothing else, he''s right about one thing.
    It is a good night.


    A good night, indeed.'
  - He then proceeds to explain the entire secret that's been entrusted to him.
  - (You have lost a decent amount of credibility)
  - He stumbles away, continuing to glare at you with such ferocity that he only
    narrowly avoids colliding with some other guests. Not exactly the sort of man
    you expected to outwit you, but... <i>c'est la vie</i>, eh?

  - '"<i>Pardon</i> monsieur, but that sounds so important. Whatever could it be?"'
  - 
  - 
  - '"Water? <i>Non</i>, that simply won''t do! Let''s find you something stronger."'
  - '"I''m certain you know much, but I have other things to attend to."'
