  - Relaxing at the party, you feel more comfortable with your new life than before.
    Sipping from your recently acquired glass of wine, you notice a fresh batch of
    hors d'oeuvres being brought out from the kitchen.
  - Suddenly, you feel someone barge into you, sending you reeling a few steps. While
    you manage to catch your balance on a nearby table, your chest feels wet, and
    your wineglass now appears to be empty. Oh no.
  - Looking down, you see an enormous wine stain down your front.
  - Turning around, you see two women, one of them is obviously deep in their cups.
    The other appears to be trying to prevent her friend from embarrassing themselves
    too much. "Sorry about the stain, we were just leaving." The sober one apologizes
    half-heartedly.
  - '"Why did we stop? Where are we going?" She slurs, looking confused.'
  - Surprised by your patience and mangnanimity, they get some water and help you
    blot at the stain before it dries completely. It's enough to get rid of most
    of the stain, but it's still noticeable to those who look for it.
  - They stare at you, wordlessly for a moment. It's as if they're bewildered by
    your simple request.
  - Before they can even say anything, they're interrupted with laughter from the
    other guests in this room, who seem to appreciate your biting wit. The pair of
    women settle on staring daggers in your direction until the laughter subsides.
  - Not only are the pair in front of you somewhat taken aback by your firm request,
    the watching crowd mutters in approval. While the two women don't seem thrilled
    about having to apologize, they can tell that the room has turned against them
    in a serious way.
  - '"Ah yes, we''ll certainly apologize for you being so careless as to spill wine
    all over yourself at the slightest nudge."'
  - With a mutter of half hearted retorts, the pair skulk away, much to the delight
    of those present. Your dress may be in worse condition than when you started,
    but at least you got to have some fun at the expense of those who deserve it.
  - 'With narry a backward glance, the two leave, giggling to themselves.


    Looking
    around at the rest of the guests at the party, hoping to find some sort of aid,
    you can tell that you''re being studiously ignored. '
  - With a mutter of apology, the pair depart and leave you alone. The crowd takes
    their focus off of you and returns to the party.
  - 'Her drunk friend decides that now would be a good time to chime in. "What''s
    wrong? It''s not like I made that dress look any worse."


    You hear a few
    people in the crowd chuckle at this clumsy barb.'
  - The room feels palpably quieter as the two of them stare at you in disbelief.
  - Then, they start to laugh.
  - '"What are you, a child?" The inebriated friend manages to ask. You can hear
    a few chuckles from the crowd around you.'
  - Eyes frowning, mouths agape, the pair just stares at you in shock.
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - '(You have gained a decent amount of credibility)

    (You have gained some
    peril)'
  - Eyes frowning, mouths agape, the pair just stares at you in shock.
  - (You have gained some credibility)
  - This feels right. You could get used to this.
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
