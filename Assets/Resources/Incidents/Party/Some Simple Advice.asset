  _nodeText:
  - You step away from the party proper to take a break in the vestibule, you scan
    the guests filing in and out of the party, trying to decide where to make your
    next move.
  - You hear the sound of a small voice, coming from the coat closet.
  - As stealthily as your finery will allow, you walk up to the closet door and press
    your ear against it.
  - Drawing up the full power of your personal indignity, you approach the closet
    door and press your ear to it.
  - 'Straining to hear what''s on the other side of the door, you don''t hear the
    messy fumbling of two lovers succumbing to their forbidden passions. In fact,
    you hear quite the opposite. It''s the mumbling and crying of a young girl. '
  - 'Straining to hear what''s on the other side of the door, you hear the mumbling
    and crying of a young girl. '
  - Judging from the sound, she can't be older than fifteen.
  - '"... I''m fine." Says the quavering voice on the other side of the closet door.'
  - '"That''s what I''m trying to do!" The voice from the closet replies. "Maybe if
    I stay here all night, I''ll stop embarassing myself."'
  - '"If I say ''boo'', will you go away?"'
  - '"No, I''m not a ghost. I''m just a failure." The voice admits.'
  - '"My parents forced me to come here, and I said a bunch of stupid stuff, and everyone
    got bored or mad, and now it''s all just as bad as I thought it''d be." The voice
    sniffles. "I just wanted to stay home and read books about spies."'
  - '"Actually, I''m not fine." The voice admits. "I''m very not fine."'
  - '"Why does anyone do this?"'
  - '"What? Why?"'
  - '"I don''t want to learn this trade! I don''t even want an apprenticeship."'
  - For a while, all you can hear is silence from the inside of the coat closet.
  - '"Uh... yes madame." She replies, thrown off by the sudden sternness in your voice.
    You can hear her fumbling for the latch of the door.'
  - '"Why do I have to do what my parents do?"'
  - '"Really? That''s why you''re here?" She asks, expressing something other than
    dejection for the first time in this entire conversation.'
  - '"Uh... I''d feel safer talking to you like this, madame." The voice says, mustering
    some defiance.'
  - '"Well, I''m not sick of reading yet..." She replies sullenly, and you can practically
    hear her pouting.'
  - '"It is really stuffy in here, and I think my foot fell asleep." She admits.'
  - '"That sounds a lot like giving up."'
  - Your doubtful silence speaks volumes.
  - Compelled by your curiosity, yet fearing the wrath of furious ghosts, you approach
    the closet door and press your ear to it.
  - 'Straining to hear what''s on the other side of the door, you don''t hear the
    wailing of those who departed this mortal coil with business unfinished. Instead,
    you hear the mumbling and crying of a young girl. '
  - Your disappointed silence speaks volumes.
  - '"I guess that make sense, but what should I do now?"'
  - '"But it''s so boooring..." Amelie whines. "All they want to do is say mean things
    about people I don''t know, and talk about plays I''ve never seen."'
  - For a while, all you can hear is silence from the inside of the coat closet.
  - '"Momma and papa told me to not say anything too controversial..." She replies,
    quietly.'
  - '"... but momma and papa aren''t here right now." She says, excitement building
    in her voice. You''re sure her parents aren''t going to love your advice, but
    who cares? They should have prepared their daughter better.


    (You have gained a significant amount of credibility)

    (You have gained a tiny amount of peril)'
  - '"Really? Someone here actually wants to talk to me? That''s might not be too
    bad..."'
  - '"I don''t think anyone here is thrilled to see me, or talk to me..."'
  - Slowly, the closet door opens all the way.
  - "With an awkward wave, Am\xE9lie departs to rejoin the party in progress. You
    see a little bit of yourself in her, and you're not sure if that's a good thing."
  - '"Alright, I opened the door, but what should I actually do?" She asks, still
    ssitting the coat closet, eyeing you warily.'
  - '"But it''s so boooring..." Amelie whines. "All they want to do is say mean things
    about people I don''t know, and talk about plays I''ve never seen."'
  - She looks at you warily, but you can tell that getting her to open the door has
    made this easier than it would have been before.
  - '"Momma and papa told me to not say anything too controversial..." She replies,
    quietly.'
  - '"Really? Someone here actually wants to talk to me? That could be good..."'
  - '"I don''t think anyone here is thrilled to see me, or talk to me..."'
  - '"... but momma and papa aren''t here right now." She says, excitement building
    in her voice. You''re sure her parents aren''t going to love your advice, but
    who cares? They should have prepared their daughter better.'
  - '"But, what should I do now?"'
  - '"But this closet is really boring." She admits.'
  - Slowly, the closet door opens all the way.
  - '"Alright... here I am. Time to go do party stuff." She says, dabbing away the
    last traces of tears from her face. It takes a few minutes, but she finally starts
    to look composed.'
  - '"Alright... here I am. Time to go do party stuff." She says, the absolute picture
    of unenthusiasm. '
  - '"But standing around here is really boring." She admits.'
  - "\"My name's Am\xE9lie, by the way...\""
  - Suddenly, your ears perk up at the sound of something unusual.
  - (You have gained a tiny amount of credibility)
  - (You have gained some credibility)
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - (You have lost a little credibility)
  - '(You have gained a little peril)

  - '"I guess this closet is pretty boring too. At least the party has snacks."'

  - <Knock on the door> "Pardon mademoiselle, are you alright?"
  - '"You might want to get out of that closet before you embarass yourself."'
  - '"Mademoiselle, are you perchance, a vengeful spirit from beyond?"'
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - '"Are you joking? When I was your age, I would have killed for this."'
  - '"We do this because we must. This socializing is a trade like any other."'
  - '"Mademoiselle, open up. I refuse to converse through a door."'
  - 
  - 
  - '"Because I read the same books, and I wanted to do what those characters did."'
  - 
  - '"I was sick of reading. I wanted something new."'
  - '"You don''t. Still, you must do something, and hiding in a closet isn''t it."'
  - '"Because that''s what we all have to do. Might as well make the most of it."'
  - 
  -

  - Because they have to. This is basically a job.
