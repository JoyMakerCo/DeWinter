  - Exploring the party, you find yourself in a quiet room that the other guests
    seem to have forgotten about. Right as you're about to leave, you hear the rustling
    of paper.
  - '"You actually got rid of him... that''s amazing." Ludovico says with an enormous
    grin. "I mean, I''ll still have to interview him later, but it''s important to
    enjoy the little miracles."'
  - Slowly and carefully, you check behind the door. That's where you find a priest
    reading a book.
  - 'Suddenly noticing you, he leaps up with a shout "<i>Figlio di puttana</i>!"


    You
    know that wasn''t French, and you''re fairly certain it wasn''t polite. '
  - '"I''m so sorry madame, you just startled me. Who are you? Are you alright?"'
  - '"It''s quite alright, Yvette." He replies, straightening out his cassock, and
    generally recomposing himself. "I shouldn''t have let myself get so lost in my
    book."'
  - He smiles and tucks the book under his arm. "Oh, if only the reasons were that
    exciting. Unfortunately, no beguiling person of mystery like yourself, just an
    avid reader."
  - The book is bound is faded red leather, and while it's well-read, doesn't appear
    to be a bible.
  - '"Let me introduce myself, I am Father Sidotti. I beg your pardon, Madame Yvette,
    I swear I''m normally more social."'
  - "You try to keep your facial expression neutral when you recognize the book,
    '<i>\r\nL'Histoire Extr\xEAmement Vraie de Julie d'Aubigny</i>'.\n\nIt's a romance,
    the tawdry kind, filled with rebellious and wanton women. Certainly a fun read,
    but not what you were expecting."
  - He notices your wandering eyes "My French is still rusty. This one was an easier
    read than the others..."
  - He glances down at the book and blushes. "It's been fun so far. I loved the escape
    from the nunnery."
  - He closes the book and tucks it under his arm. "Don't trouble yourself with that
    madame. This is from my own collection."
  - '"Please let me introduce myself, I am Father Sidotti." He says with a polite
    nod of his head. '
  - His expression goes blank for a moment, and he examines your face carefully.
    "You're Yvette Decaux are you not? You certainly match her description."
  - '"It''s just that my recent assignment has been rather... unbearable."'
  - He flushes with embarrassment for a moment before turning his head from you and
    pouting. "I don't have to justify this! Everyone has their way of dealing with
    the world's slings and arrows, this one is mine."
  - '"Recently my superiors in Rome assigned me to interview one ''Monsieur Bellande''.
    We''re trying to form a complete picture of the situation in France. Tonight,
    I''ve tried to speak with him..."'
  - '"A few months ago, my superiors in Rome sent me to observe what''s happening
    in France. There''s a lot going on in your country right now and the cardinals
    like to stay informed."'
  - '"... but he''s awful! I''ve never met a man so determined to see the worst in
    everything."'
  - '"As part of my assignment, I''m supposed to interview this ''Monsieur Bellande'',
    whose donations to his parish have been very generous in the last few years..."'
  - '"Madame, I can safely assure you that he is." He states, eyes focused on something
    distant and terrible. "The man spent thirty minutes complaining about music.
    Not a particular kind, he complained about the entire concept of music!"'
  - '"That''s not what I meant, but I''d love to see it anyway." He says with a laugh.
    "If my duty didn''t require me to forgive man''s failings, I''d be eager to try
    it myself."'
  - '"While I''ll appreciate any help you could provide, I just can''t think of what
    you could do." He admits. "The man is just utterly incorrigible."'
  - '"But please, enough of my martyrdom! What brings you here?"'
  - '"Well, I''m glad to hear that you''re as interesting as they say, Madame Decaux."
    He replies with a broad smile. "I have to admit this party was not particularly
    interesting until you arrived."'
  - '"So am I." He replies with a twinkle in his eye. "Though I think things are
    already getting better.'
  - His smile is pleasant, but perfunctory. "Ah, thank you madame. The support of
    our flock is the lifeblood of any parish, and of the Faith in general."
  - At that moment, a dour and unsatisfied looking man enters the room, his brow
    knit in a permanent furrow. "Ah, there you are, Father Sidotti! I thought you
    had gotten lost. This building is rather poorly designed, you see."
  - '"Is this lady bothering you?"'
  - '"Ah, finally someone who knows the importance of manners!" Monsieur Bellande
    replies with a thin smile. "Please do be a dear and remain silent for a moment,
    so I might be done with this quickly."'
  - '"A matter of faith?"'
  - '"Well, I can see that my fine observations would be wasted on the likes of you."
    He replies petulantly, fixing you with a vicious glare.'
  - "\"Actually madame, I don't think that's true. Even if it was, I would not allow
    it to delay my important business. Step aside, \r<i>s'il vous pla\xEEt</i>.\""
  - '"Ah yes, I suppose your inconveniences would have to take priority over my interview."
    Monsieur Bellande replies, trapped by the needs of propriety.'
  - The two of you chat for a little bit longer, and seem to get along quite well.
    Father Sidotti is remarkably well-read, and you never expected to find yourself
    discussing Voltaire and Goethe with a Catholic priest.
  - '"By the way, the next time we see each other, I would actually prefer if you
    called me Ludovico, if that''s alright."'
  - With that, he gives you a short bow, and leaves to attend to other matters at
    the party.
  - '"It''s been a pleasure Madame Decaux, perhaps we''ll see each other again soon?"'
  - With the priest on your mind, you leave the now abandoned room to explore your
    other opportunities at the party.
  - Puzzling over the question of this priest, you leave the now abandoned room to
    explore your other opportunities at the party.
  - '"Ah, what am I doing? I beg your pardon, Madame Yvette. I swear I''m normally
    more social."'
  - "\"However.\" He whispers. \"One must remember that, in this city, even the walls
    have ears.\" \n\nYou hear the footsteps of a servant going by, and wonder if
    you're proclamation will reach the ears of your various enemies. It seems likely."
  - 'He leaves, grumbling something about ''feminine inconstancy'' or the like. '
  - Your stomach churns at the thought of doing anything this man tells you to do,
    but you step away from the conversation and let the two of them finish their
    interview. Father Sidotti spends the entire time looking like he's handling a
    viper by the tail. Thankfully, Monsieur Bellande seems too interested in himself
    to notice.
  - Finally, they finish up, and the interviewee departs.
  - '"You... you actually got rid of him. That was amazing." He says, astonished.'
  - Your brow furrowed in concern, you take a moment to compose yourself before you
    leave the now abandoned room to explore your other opportunities at the party.
  - 'At that moment, a dour and unsatisfied looking man enters the room, his brow
    knit in a permanent furrow.


    "I stand corrected." Father Sidotti mumbles
    to you.'
  - '"Ah, there you are, Father Sidotti! I thought you had gotten lost. This building
    is rather poorly designed, you see."'
  - He turns on his heel and leaves as quickly as he came. Father Sidotti stares
    at the doorway in stunned silence.

  - '"I''m sorry for that madame, his words were completely uncalled for. Unfortunately,
    I''m not really in a position to start scolding important contributors, no matter
    how boorish they are."'
  - (You have lost some credibility)

    the party.
  - "As soon as he moves out of sight, your spymistress Th\xE9r\xE8se appears from
    her place in the shadows."
  - '"A priest, walking willingly into temptation? Oh, how that sounds all too familiar."
    She clucks her tongue and smiles."'
  - '"Still, despite his... eagerness, that one seems too cautious to simply run
    headlong into your clutches. Keep seeking him out at Church parties, and I think
    you may be able to find a pretense to otherwise meet up with him in public."'
  - With that said, your servant slips back into the shadows, and you are left to
    your own devices.

  - '"Forgive me father, that was my fault. My name is Yvette."'
  - '"I''m Yvette Decaux. What are you doing here? Trying to uncover our host''s
    terrible secrets?"'
  - <Examine his book>
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - '"Well, at least you found something exciting. I loved the horse chase near the
    end."'
  - '"<i>Oui</i> Father Sidotti. Would you like some help finding something more
    appropriate?"'
  - 
  - 
  - '"Is that why you''re hiding in a corner and reading?"'
  - '"Unbearable? How so?"'
  - '"Assignment? What are you doing here, exactly?"'
  - 
  -

  - '"Oh, he can''t be that bad, can he?"'
  - '"So you''re saying that I can be as rude as I like to him, and it won''t change
    anything?"'
  - '"Is there anything I can do to help?"'
  - 
  - "\"My fianc\xE9's missing, I'm seeking revenge on a prominent noble, and I like
    the wine here.\""
  - '"Just looking for something exciting to do."'

  - 
  - 
  - '"Please, don''t mind me, finish your interview."'
  - '"I''m sorry Monsieur Bellande, but he is assisting me with a matter of faith
    that can''t wait."'
  - '"No, I''m not, Monsieur. You see, people come to parties to actually enjoy themselves."'
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - '"What a sweet man, hopefully I''ll see him soon."'
