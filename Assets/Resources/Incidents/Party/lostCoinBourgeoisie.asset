  - Feeling the need to take a quick break, you step away from the crowds, and take
    a moment to just breathe.
  - While you're composing yourself, a chambermaid approaches you. She's holding
    a small, unmarked pouch of coins.
  - '"Do you know who this might belong to? Otherwise..."'
  - '"The wallet is yours?"'
  - '"Oh madame, you''re absolutely right! I can''t believe I forgot!" She replies,
    with outrageously feigned surprise. '
  - '"Madame, where could you have gotten that idea?" She replies, eyes darting about.'
  - The two of you split the money found in the wallet, and the chambermaid tucks
    the emptied article into her bodice. "I can't imagine anyone careless enough
    to leave this lying around will mind too much." She says with a shrug.
  - With an exchange of smiles, the chambermaid curtsies politely and leaves. Feeling
    reinvigorated, you decide to investigate the rest of the party.
  - '"Oh, well I''m glad I found you." She mumbles, obviously disappointed.'
  - The Chambermaid glowers at you. "Madame, I must admit that I find this hard to
    believe, given that this is obviously a man's wallet."
  - The two of you check the party together, looking for the owner of the mysterious
    wallet.
  - Eventually, you come upon a man who recognizes it immediately. "Oh, thank you
    so much! I hadn't even realized I'd misplaced it." Some of the nearby guests
    murmur approvingly of your honesty.
  - '"However, if I am mistaken, you may consult our host and have it returned to
    you." A task which you both know that you will not attempt.'
  - "With a fake smile, the chambermaid curtsies politely and leaves. \n\nMuttering
    a choice selection of curses, you decide to investigate the rest of the party."
  - With a polite nod, you excuse yourself and leave to explore the rest of the party.
  - She hands you the wallet, and curtsies politely. You make a great show of thumbing
    through this mysterious wallet to make sure that everything is there.
  - Before the chambermaid can ask you any more questions, you excuse yourself and
    leave to investigate the rest of the party.
  - After a few second of bluster, she calms down. "I suppose you're right. If we
    make a circuit of the party together, we might be able to find the owner this
    time."
  - '"<i>Pardonnez-moi</i>, madame. I found this wallet while I was tidying up. I
    took it to my employer, but they don''t recognize it. I''ve been told not to
    rest until the owner is found."'
  - '(You have lost some credibility)

    (You have gained some peril)'
  - (You have gained 57 Livres)
  - (You have gained 28 Livres)
  - '(You have gained a little credibility)

    (You have reduced your peril a tiny
    bit)'
