  _nodeText:
  - You find yourself in a conversation with Alex and his friend, Corporal d'Auvergne
  - 'They seem to pass the time as most soldiers do: by complaining. Mostly, their
    conversation revolves around how poorly paid they are, and how most of the officers
    in their unit purchased their commissions, and thus their ranks.'
  - '"Well, let''s not jump to too many conclusions there, d''Auvergne. My own father
    purchased his commission as well."'
  - '"At this point, we should salute whoever we like! Who would our comrades support?"'
  - '"Then again, that''s not exactly an endorsement."'
  - '"We should acknowledge the Crown first?"'
  - '"We should acknowledge the Revolution in the Third Estate first?"'
  - While your spymistress isn't here, at this very moment, you've had many enlightening
    conversations with her. In fact, this was something she brought up with you recently.
  - '"On a different note, we''ve spent the last few days drilling for a parade a
    few days from now. We''ll all get gussied up and ride around in circles, only
    this time there''s a whole contingent of mayors and judges representing the Third
    Estate, sitting near His Majesty. The problem is nobody''s told us who we''re
    supposed to salute first."'
  - '"They don''t even care about what we''re being asked to do. It''s just how they
    pad their pedigrees."'
  - While such a concern might seem trivial at first, it's anything but. A salute
    is an open declaration of who one respects, and ultimately to who they are loyal
    to. Such a declaration could increase the perceived standing of that faction.
  - The Military is currently aligned with the Crown, and you say as much.
  - The Military is currently aligned with the Revolution, and you say as much.
  - '"That sounds exactly what our comrades in arms would want us to do!" Alex laughs.'
  - '"Absolutely not! None of our comrades would ever agree to that!" Alex replies,
    shocked at this suggestion.'
  - '"That sounds exactly what our comrades in arms would want us to do!" Alex laughs.'
  - '"Absolutely not! Why would our comrades ever agree to that?" Alex replies, shocked
    at this suggestion.'
  - '(You have lost a little favor with Alex)

    (You have lost some credibility)'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - '(You have lost a little favor with Alex)

    (You have lost some credibility)'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - '"I''m sure this is going to ruffle more than a few feathers, but we might as
    well spread the word that this is what we''re going with. If command doesn''t
    like it, they should have given us actual directions."'
  - '"Madame Decaux makes a point Alex." Corporal d''Auvergne grumbles. "Let''s be
    honest, we don''t really have a choice in the matter, do we?"'
  - By affirming the power of the Crown, they'll have functionally snubbed the officials
    from the Third Estate.
  - '(The Crown has gained a little power)

    (The Revolution has lost a little
    power)'
  - '"I''m sure this is going to ruffle more than a few feathers, but we might as
    well spread the word that this is what we''re going with. If command doesn''t
    like it, they should have given us actual directions."'
  - '"Well, to the devil with you then!" Corporal d''Auvergne with a surprising fervor.
    "It''s what I''m telling the unit that we''re doing. It might take a moment to
    get them to agree, but I bet they''re as sick of getting pushed around as I am."'
  - This upset of precedent will deal a significant blow to the Crown. The problem
    with the Crown living and dying by their storied traditions is that any violation
    of their protocol will serve as a sign that they're losing their grip on power.
  - '(The Revolution has gained a little power)

    (The Crown has lost a little
    power)'
  - '"Ah, it seems I was thirstier than I thought!" Alex laughs, realizing that he''s
    been sipping at an empty glass for some time.'
  - '"Have no fear, I''ll take care of that. You should stay here and keep this good
