  - Striding through the party, keeping your eyes open for something interesting,
    you manage to spot Ludovico, that intriguing priest from before. He appears to
    be talking to someone else already, but you approach them regardless.
  - '"... which is why I''ll have to travel overland if I''m to return to Rome, when
    all of this is concluded. Ships might be too much for me."'
  - '"All because you performed a man''s last rites? I feel like the ship''s captain
    overreacted. You were just doing your duty." The woman replies. "By the way,
    where did you learn Turkish in the first place?"'
  - 'Noticing you, Ludovico suddenly perks up. "Oh my, Yvette, it''s good to see
    you again!"


    Turning to the woman, he introduces you "This is my friend,
    Madame Decaux, have the two of you met before?"'
  - Her mouth falls agape "Wait, you're Yvette Decaux? As in, the infamous Madame
    Decaux?"
  - '"Oh, really?" She titters behind her hand. "I''ve already heard some outrageous
    stories, so you must be quite fascinating."'
  - '"Oh, given what I''ve heard, I had to assume some of them were simply fancies."
    She replies with a giggle. '
  - '"I''ve been extremely busy lately. My superiors at the parish I''ve been assigned
    to have all come down with a terrible fever, so I''ve been leading mass for last
    few days."'
  - '"It''s been years, and I still get nervous speaking in front of crowds." He
    sighs.'
  - '"Yes, well, in my experience Yvette has always been rather bold." Ludovico says
    with a smile.'
  - '"Yes, well, even Yvette can be the victim of simple rumor mongering." Ludovico
    agrees.'
  - '"As for myself," Ludovico continues "I''ve been extremely busy lately. My superiors
    at the parish I''ve been assigned to have all come down with a debilitating fever,
    so I''ve been leading mass for the last few days."'
  - He turns to the other woman "I'm sorry madame, but can you excuse us? I need
    to speak to Yvette alone for the moment."
  - '"Oh really?" She replies. "Whatever for?"'
  - '"Really? Books, you say?" She asks with a cocked eyebrow. "While I can''t imagine
    why that would require a private conversation, I''ll respect your wishes."'
  - '"Oh, ho ho! Aren''t you the wicked one?" She laughs, narrowing her eyes at you.
    "Good luck, Father Sidotti."'
  - '"Ah, yes. This information is a private matter of the utmost importance." Ludovico
    chimes in, helpfully.'
  - '"Ah, but of course! I won''t take up anymore of your time."'
  - '"A private matter, you say?" She asks. "I suppose I can leave the two of you
    to your devices."


    You get the feeling that she doesn''t believe your cover
    story at all.'
  - '"We''re finally alone." He says with a sigh of relief. '
  - She leaves, casting more than one devious glance back at the two of you as she
    does so. Ludovico says nothing, but the grin on his face already tells you everything
    you need to know.
  - She leaves, casting more than one suspicious glance back at the two of you as
    she does so.
  - She leaves, casting more than one suspicious glance back at the two of you as
    she does so.
  - With a polite curtsey, she disappears into the crowd. You can hear Ludovico mumbling
    a prayer to himself. "That was probably not the best reason I've born false witness."
    He admits with a sheepish grin.
  - '"As I said before, I''m leading mass at the church I''ve been assigned to, in
    the south of Paris. It may not be the most glamorous district, but the building
    is beautiful and our choir is quite lovely."'
  - '"I''m holding mass there every day for the foreseeable future, and I''d love
    for you to attend."'
  - '"I''d love to see you and well..." He blushes, trailing off.'
  - '"Well, I''ve never really done one of these before, so it might not be a very
    good one... but yes, this is exactly what you think it is, Yvette."'
  - '"It''s only perfect if you''re there."'
  - It was only a quick peck on the cheek, but you can tell that it caught him completely
    off guard. His face is caught in a mixture of shock, fear, and joy.
  - 'You can also tell that Ludovico wasn''t the only one that noticed your indiscretions,
    but the public''s indignation is part of the appeal, isn''t it? '
  - '"I know this all sounds strange, but with my vows, I have to be more discreet
    than most. I''d still like to see you, and you being seen attending one of my
    sermons is one the best ways for us to establish a public relationship."'
  - '"That is, if you''d like for us to have a relationship, at all." He says, equal
    parts coy and hopeful. '
  - With that, he disappears into the crowd.
  - With a lighter step than normal, you set off to explore the party, wondering
    about the future holds for you and a certain priest.
  - Distracted by the events that have just transpired, you set off to explore the
    party, wondering about the future holds for you.
  - With that, you disappear into the crowd, while you still have an air of mystery
    about you.
  - With a lighter step than normal, you set off to explore the party, wondering

  - Someone in a nearby crowd calls out to Ludovico. "It appears that I am needed
    elsewhere. <i>Addio</i>, Yvette."
  - '"Oh, well..." Ludovico mumbles as he sips his wine. "Faith can accomplish a
    great many things."'

    about you.
  - With that, he disappears into the crowd.
  - "The moment he slips out of sight, your spymistress Th\xE9r\xE8se is already
    at your side."
  - '"While I doubt you require my counsel at this particular juncture, I would feel
    remiss if I didn''t do the job you pay me for. If you want to win the young man''s
    heart, you''ll have to take him up on that invitation. It will let you both establish
    a cover story for meeting up unsupervised in public." '
  - With that said, she nods to you and disappears back into the shadows. You set
    off to explore the party, wondering about the future holds for you.
