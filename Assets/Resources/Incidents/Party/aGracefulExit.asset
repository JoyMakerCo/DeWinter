    Description: "You spot Anne de Crosmaire once again, and she seems to be troubled
      by having a lead that she can\u2019t possibly use. With some convincing, perhaps
      you can find a use for such a thing."

  - Moving through the hallowed halls of the party in this particular Cathedral,
    you come across a familiar face.
  - '"<i>Bonjour</i>, Yvette. How are you? Has Pierre been murdered by a bookie,
    yet?"'
  - '"I''m not sure if there''s enough votive candles in the city to allow for that."'
  - '"Ah, my mistake!" She laughs. "You''re not wrong. I remember I once watched
    a pair of ruffians hired by the <i>Duc d''Orleans</i> throw him under the wheels
    of a moving carriage. Little did they know this wasn''t the first time someone
    had made such an attempt." '
  - "\"Truth be told, I wish him the best. Pierre has a certain\u2026 charm to him,
    as baffling as it can be sometimes.\""
  - '"I see that you''re also skulking around this party, amongst hoping to find
    some useful, scandalous news from these beatific souls." She quips, gesturing
    at the guests around you. "Honestly, it''s too easy. Isn''t it shocking what
    you hear people say when they think that they''re surrounded by like minds, safe
    from judgement?"'
  - '"While I still have my faith, I see the Church as something more akin to a family.
    You love them all, but sometimes you do wish they''d simply stop talking before
    they end up embarrassing everyone."'
  - '"You really just want me to give this to you?"'
  - '"Ah, of course." She sighs with a scowl that is quickly concealed. "You''re
    still Pierre''s friend, after all."'
  - '"Well, a small payment is certainly better than nothing." She replies with a
    smile.'
  - '"Yvette, you''re lucky that you''re so charming. If you weren''t..." Anne says,
    trailing off before she can finish that thought aloud.'
  - '"Telling you what I overheard still puts me at considerable risk, for nothing.
    I like you Yvette, but I don''t like you enough to do that."'
  - '"If I published it through my contacts, it would be traced back to me almost
    immediately."'
  - '"Instead Pierre managed to roll past the horses'' hooves, dodge the carriage''s
    wheels, and grasp the underside of the vehicle. The carriage dragged him away
    to safety, with him cackling and cursing at his attackers all the way."'
  - '"As a matter of fast, I heard the Cardinal de Rohan say something particularly
    egregious, almost too much so." She sighs and shakes her head. "You''d think
    a man with a reputation like his would learn to be more discreet."'
  - (You have gained a decent amount of peril)
  - (You have spent 20 Livres)
  - '"So, here''s what I know..." She says, as she begins to lay out the details
    of what she overheard the Cardinal saying.'
  - (You have gained a piece of Shocking Church Gossip)
  - (You have gained a piece of Outrageous Church Gossip)
  - 'You don''t take much additional time to chat with Anne, as you both clearly
    have a lot to accomplish today. Instead you respect each other''s time, and depart
    with a simple nod. '
  - (You have lost a decent amount of credibility)
  _linkText:
  - '"Unfortunately, yes. In fact, the reason I''m here is to pray for his poor,
    departed soul."'
  - '"You should know better than to think he could be killed so easily."'
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - '"Well, if you can''t use it, I could always take it. There''s no sense in waste,
    right?"'
  - '"Either you tell me what that was, or I can tell him that you''ve been spying
    on him."'
  - '"That''s a shame. What if I paid you a small finder''s fee for that gossip?"'
  - 
  - '"Do you really wish him ill?"'
