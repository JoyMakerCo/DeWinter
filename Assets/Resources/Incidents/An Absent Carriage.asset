  - "Before you can reply, a valet grabs you roughly by the arm and drags you from
    the study. People like your loathsome host don\u2019t need to do their own dirty
    work, they have servants for that. It takes far longer than you\u2019d like to
    get outside, as the entryway is crowded with guests preparing to leave.\r\n \r\nYou
    can feel their eyes weighing heavily on you. \r"
  - "When you finally get to the door, you feel a brutish shove, and you stumble out
    into the courtyard, barely keeping your balance in your heels. The area is equally
    crowded, with various persons entering their personal carriages. \r\n\r\nYou can
    hear somebody snicker, but you have no idea who it was.\r"
  - "The only thing left to do is go home.\r"
  - Choosing to take the high ground, you straighten your posture and hold your head
    high, striding towards your carriage as if it was your intention to leave like
    this all along. While you make a great effort to haughtily avoid eye contact with
    all of those watching you, you can tell that some of them are quite surprised
    by your decorum in this dire situation.
  - "Boiling over with anger, you turn and rain insults upon the house. In fact, you
    consider throwing your shoe through one of their windows, before you remember
    how much you like that shoe. It\u2019s then that you notice that several of the
    carriages have stopped, just to watch your display."
  - "However, when you arrive at the place where your carriage is parked, you quickly
    find out that\u2026 it isn\u2019t. \r"
  - "Scanning the faces of your new audience, you see the glaring, unamused faces
    of the various party guests. You\u2019re certain that your hatred of Maximin,
    the Revolution, and everything else he stands for is going to be well known throughout
    the city soon enough.\r"
  - "You check to make sure that you\u2019re in the right place, but to no avail.
    The carriage you hired is simply not there."
  - "Before you can even respond, he gets his carriage moving, leaving you alone with
    yet another indignity. \r\n\r\nGoing back to Maximin is obviously unacceptable,
    it\u2019s too far to walk home, and most of the other guests have already left.
    \r"
  - "However, there appear to be three other carriages waiting to leave, each of them
    quite different. Perhaps one of them can help?\r"
  - "The carriage to the left of you is of foreign design, and features a gilded crest
    as its only ornamentation. This crest is emblazoned with a motto in latin, and
    appears to belong to a priest of some description. The curtains are drawn, but
    someone appears to have lit a lantern inside. Judging by the occupant\u2019s silhouette,
    it looks like he\u2019s reading."
  - "The carriage in front of you is obviously being used by a soldier of some sort.
    The driver is leaning intently towards the passenger compartment, waiting for
    orders. You recognize the insignia of the Queen\u2019s Dragoons on the side of
    the carriage. It feels noble and proud, but also capable."
  - "The carriage to your right is richly decorated, yet somber. Swags of black crepe
    hang from the roof of the carriage, leaving only glimmers of the gold underneath.
    The decidedly feminine bent of the decorations indicates that the occupant is
    a woman, but all of the black suggests that she\u2019s in mourning."
  - "You consider the humble carriage for a moment. Is this who you\u2019d like to
    ride with?"
  - Settled in your decision, you set out, ready to entrust your fortune to a modest
    stranger.
  - "You consider the bold carriage for a moment, is this who you\u2019d like to ride
    with?\r"
  - Settled in your decision, you set out, ready to entrust your fortune to an honorable
    stranger.
  - "You consider the extravagant carriage for a moment, is this who you\u2019d like
    to ride with?"
  - Settled in your decision, you set out, ready to entrust your fortune to a mysterious
    stranger.
  - You grace the voyeurs with a haughty sneer before leaving towards your own carriage.
  - "(You have lost some favor with members of the Revolution)\r\n(You have gained
    some favor with members of the Crown)\r"
  - "(You\x19 have gained some credibility)\r"
  - "It\x19's gone. "
  - "\"He went home!\" A passing coachman says helpfully, while adjusting the harness
    on a particularly grumpy horse. \x1C\"Doorman came out about an hour ago, and
    told him you wanted the coach to leave without you. Seemed real important, so
    he went home.\x1D\r\""
