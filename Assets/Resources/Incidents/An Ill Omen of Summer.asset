  - It... it is hot this morning. Sweltering, even.
  - 'In fact, this summer has been so hot over the last few days that new outrageous
    reports are surfacing every day. Yesterday you heard someone say the River Seine
    has started to bubble and steam in the heat. '
  - Specifically, in regards to the King's equestrian statue in <i>La Place Royale</i>.
    Some have said that the scepter of the bronze statue has begun to melt and droop
    in the heat, and they take it as an ill-omen.
  - Reacting quickly to this, the king recently ordered some workmen to go out and
    fix any damage they might find. Said artisans were quite puzzled to find that,
    when they arrived, there was nothing wrong with the statue at all.
  - The whole thing has been dismissed as baseless fear mongering, and whoever was
    peddling the rumors must look absolutely ridiculous.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - Not only that, those rumors have been fuelled by the tale of an anonymous witness,
    who claimed that one midsummer night, the statue of the King was seen to be sweating
    drops of dark, viscous blood.
  - '(The Revolution has gained a little power)

    (The Crown has lost a little power)'
  - '(The Crown has gained a little power)

    (The Revolution has lost a little power)'
  - You're not sure if this is report is actually true, but it sure seems to have
    been a cause for alarm among many in the city. Even those who would openly disdain
    such pagan notions of augury have been shaken by such an ominous portent.
  - While you're sure that some of this is merely the result of heat-stroke and boredom,
    there are some rumors that have taken a deeper root amongst the populace.
