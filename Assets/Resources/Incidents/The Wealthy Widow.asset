  _nodeText:
  - The coachman pays you no heed as you approach the sumptuously decorated carriage.
    Normally, you find yourself to be quite fearless in social situations, but something
    about this whole scenario gives you pause.
  - "Should you knock on the door? Call out? You\u2019ve heard that courtiers in Versailles
    grow out one of their fingernails, so they can scratch on the door, as it\u2019s
    considered less disruptive. Locked in this cycle of indecision, you curse the
    fact that you cut your nails this morning.\r"
  - "\u201CWhat seems to be troubling you, madame?\u201D calls out a voice from inside
    the carriage."
  - "\u201CCertainly, I should be able to help with that.\u201D The voice replies."
  - "\u201CHow tragic,\u201D replies the voice with a trace of amusement. \u201CWhat
    kind of person would I be, if I didn\u2019t take pity on such a helpless soul?\u201D
    \r"
  - You hear some rustling from inside the carriage, and she opens the door for you.
    You help yourself into the carriage.
  - "After a few seconds, your eyes adjust to the shadows and you see the woman in
    front of you. She\u2019s older than yourself, but still younger than you\u2019d
    expect. Dressed in luxurious mourning clothes, she reclines easily in her seat,
    clutching a fine glass filled with water.\r"
  - "\u201CRen\xE9, the door please.\u201D"
  - "With that, Ren\xE9, the coachman hops down from his box and opens the door for
    you. He wears the same, colorful livery of most servants, but it\u2019s adorned
    with a black badge on his breast. You squint to peer at the woman inside, but
    to no avail. Between the swags of black crepe obscuring the windows, and the lack
    of lanterns within the carriage, the entire inside is shrouded in gloom. "
  - A delicate, pale hand reaches out from the darkness to you. You take her hand
    and step inside.
  - "\u201CMy name is Honorade, what should I call you? Madame\u2026\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Yvette Decaux. Shall we be off?\u201D"
  - "\u201CJust Yvette it is, then.\u201D She replies with a shrug. \u201CShall we
    be off?\u201D\r"
  - "She knocks delicately on the roof compartment, and with a clean crack of the
    coachman\u2019s whip, the carriage makes way towards Paris.\r"
  - "\u201CWhile I saw you a few times during the party tonight, and I know that you\u2019re
    new to Paris, we never had a chance to properly introduce ourselves. However,
    I did manage to hear about your most unfortunate run in with our host.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhy were they so dreadfully cruel to you?\u201D"
  - "Honorade doesn\u2019t speak for a while, instead choosing to stare into her glass
    of water with an expression of surprise and disgust."
  - "\u201CIf you insist\u2026\u201D Honorade replies, looking off to the side while
    she sips at her water. \u201CHowever, at the risk of being intrusive, I must caution
    against carrying all of your burdens alone. It is not healthy.\u201D"
  - "After a long silence, Honorade leans over to the window and looks out through
    one of the few spots not obscured by black crepe.\n\n\u201CNow, I\u2019m sure
    you already know just how dangerous it is to accept rides home from strangers.
    We could be going anywhere right now, and you wouldn\u2019t even know it.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CHow vile,\u201D she replies. \u201CTo find a person who has been beset
    by such great misfortune, then to mistreat them so, just to posture among one\u2019s
    cohorts? That is truly despicable.\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CYou must be quite strong, to endure such dreadful treatment.\u201D"
  - "She examines you intently while she sips her water. \u201CI assume you are already
    planning your revenge, <i>non</i>?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI know I would be\u2026\u201D"
  - "You are slightly uncomfortable, probably because she\u2019s making a good point.
    You stop to wonder if you\u2019d be any good at leaping from a moving carriage.\r"
  - "Honorade interrupts your train of thought \u201CBut of course, the best way to
    fix that, is by not being strangers. Ask me some questions, so you may properly
    judge my character.\u201D"
  - "\u201CPlease, indulge me. What would you like to know?\u201D"
  - "She sighs. \u201CThat is a reasonable question, though not one I like answering.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWould you believe that I don\u2019t? Not really, at least.\u201D She chuckles
    into her glass before taking a leisurely sip. \u201COf course, now that I know
    what they did to you, I have no intention of getting to know that conniving wretch
    at all.\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou see, as of last week... it\u2019s been two and a half years.\u201D "
  - "You maintain a neutral expression, but you can\u2019t help but dwell on the fact
    that two and a half years is far longer than any prescribed period of mourning.
    You\u2019ve heard of widows wearing a black weeper on their gowns for a few months
    longer than most, but this is something else entirely. \r"
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re very polite. Most, when they hear that, take it upon themselves
    to chide me for my \u2018breach of decency\u2019.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat do you think? Is two and a half years too long to mourn for lost love?\u201D"
  - "Despite her mournful trappings, you haven\u2019t yet seen Honorade look particularly
    forlorn."
  - "\u201CI can\u2019t say that I agree, or at least I don\u2019t think that mourning\u2019s
    set length is there for a good reason. I think those rules were set up by those
    who can\u2019t stand to see others in pain, so they simply demanded that everyone
    buries how they feel.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI think so too,\u201D Honorade replies, her lips twisting up into a devilish
    smile. \u201CHow can we say that we love someone, if we\u2019re not willing to
    defy the rules of decency to do it?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CUntil a few years ago, I was actually quite the homebody. My husband\u2019s
    textile mills made more than enough money for me to live a life of leisure, which
    he was happy to let me do. Though, I\u2019m sure he was frustrated by my unwillingness
    to attend all the big parties his clients would throw.\u201D"
  - "\u201CCrowds don\u2019t really suit me, you see. I prefer more\u2026 intimate
    gatherings.\u201D "
  - "\u201CHowever, when Charles passed, I kept getting invitations. He had so many
    friends, and I hated the idea of letting him down more than the idea of being
    in a room filled with people I don\u2019t care about, so I started going.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CHah! Listen to me. That was certainly more than you asked for. Now, what
    about you?\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat made you want to come to Paris?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou left everything behind and travelled far away, all for love?\u201D
    Honorade smiles distantly and runs her hand along the satin cushion that she\u2019s
    sitting on. \u201CI like that.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIt must have been quite an awful, stifling place to make you run half way
    across the country to be here.\u201D"
  - "She may only be a few years older than you, but the way Honorade smiles at your
    answer is almost nostalgic. \u201CRunning away to the beauty of Paris? To see
    and be seen among the philosophers and the persons of fashion?\u201D\r"

    feel that the trappings suit me, <i>non</i>?\""
  - "\u201CForgive me for being rude, but I imagine your next question is that you\u2019re
    wondering how I know our host.\u201D"
  - "She\u2019s not wrong."
  - "\u201CTo answer your question, which I\u2019ve so rudely stated for you: I don\u2019t.
    Not really, at least.\u201D She chuckles into her glass before taking a leisurely
    sip. \u201COf course, now that I know what they did to you, I have no intention
    of getting to know that conniving wretch at all.\u201D"
  - "\u201CLife is for the living, but feeling is a part of living, even when the

  - "\u201CWe yearn for a beloved that would do anything for us, and us for them.

  - "\u201CI\u2019m glad to know you haven\u2019t fallen into that little trap, yourself.\u201D"
  - "\u201CUntil a few years ago, I was actually quite the homebody. My husband\u2019s
    textile mills made more than enough money for me to live a life of leisure, which
    he was happy to let me do. Though, I\u2019m sure he was frustrated by my unwillingness
    to attend all the big parties his clients would throw.\u201D"
  - "\u201CCrowds don\u2019t really suit me, you see. I prefer more\u2026 intimate
    gatherings.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHowever, when Charles passed, I kept getting invitations. He had so many
    friends, and I hated the idea of letting him down more than the idea of being
    in a room filled with people I don\u2019t care about, so I started going.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CHah! Listen to me. That was certainly more than you asked for. Now, what
    about you?\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat made you want to come to Paris?\u201D"
  - "\u201CYou left everything behind and travelled far away, all for love?\u201D
    Honorade smiles distantly and runs her hand along the satin cushion that she\u2019s
    sitting on. \u201CI like that.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIt must have been quite an awful, stifling place to make you run half way
    across the country to be here.\u201D"
  - "She may only be a few years older than you, but the way Honorade smiles at your
    answer is almost nostalgic. \u201CRunning away to the beauty of Paris? To see
    and be seen among the philosophers and the persons of fashion?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re ruled by your passions. Such things aren\u2019t in vogue in
    this \u2018Age of Reason\u2019, but I feel like if one is going to be controlled
    by anything, it should be love.\u201D"
  - "\u201CPerhaps I am getting ahead of myself, but I imagine the next question you\u2019ll
    ask me is how long I have been in mourning for, no?\u201D\r"
  - "She\u2019s not wrong."
  - "\u201CThen again, you wouldn\u2019t be the first.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThat\u2019s really sweet, and I\u2019m not just making fun. You are a sweet
    woman.\u201D"
  - "She sighs. \u201CThat is a reasonable question, though not one I like answering.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou see, as of last week... it\u2019s been two and a half years.\u201D"
  - "You maintain a neutral expression, but you can\u2019t help but dwell on the fact
    that two and a half years is far longer than any prescribed period of mourning.
    You\u2019ve heard of widows wearing a black weeper on their gowns for a few months
    longer than most, but this is something else entirely. \r"
  - "\u201CYou\u2019re very polite. Most, when they hear that, take it upon themselves
    to chide me for my \u2018breach of decency\u2019.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat do you think? Is two and a half years too long to mourn for lost love?\u201D"
  - "Despite her mournful trappings, you haven\u2019t yet seen Honorade look particularly
    forlorn."
  - "\u201CI can\u2019t say that I agree, or at least I don\u2019t think that mourning\u2019s
    set length is there for a good reason. I think those rules were set up by those
    who can\u2019t stand to see others in pain, so they simply demanded that everyone
    buries how they feel.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI think so too,\u201D Honorade replies, her lips twisting up into a devilish
    smile. \u201CHow can we say that we love someone, if we\u2019re not willing to
    defy the rules of decency to do it?\u201D\r"
  - Until now.

  - "As the journey drags on, the conversation slows down. The darkness, and rocking
    of the carriage, combined with the exhaustion of the night\u2019s events slow
    you to a crawl."
  - "The journey to your home in Paris lasts for a long time, but it doesn\u2019t
    feel that way. Honorade plays the part of hostess wonderfully, always managing
    to guide the conversation in a satisfying direction. Unlike so many other of the
    persons you\u2019ve met in Paris, she seems completely uninterested in polite
    small talk, focusing instead on more interesting subjects.\r"
  - Soon, you find yourself struggling just to stay awake. Every blink feels like
    it lasts an hour.
  - The lurching stop of the carriage jolts you awake. You notice a wet patch of drool
    on the corner of your mouth, which you furiously blot away with a handkerchief.
  - "With a rustle of skirts, Honorade leans to the carriage door and opens it for
    you. As you\u2019re helping yourself down into the streets, Honorade peers out
    at your shabby home and simply shrugs to you.\r\n\n\u201CDon't worry. Everyone
    has to start somewhere.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CHopefully, we shall meet again under better circumstances. <i>Bonne nuit</i>,
    Yvette.\u201D She says to you before closing the carriage door. With a crack of
    his whip overhead, Ren\xE9, the coachman spurs the horses into action, and the
    carriage winds through the streets and disappears into the night.\r"
  - You turn to your home and see that Camille is already there, holding the door
    open for you.
  - "\u201CWho was that?\u201D she asks."
  - You step inside and head upstairs, your mind still reeling from the day's events.
    Slowly, you get undressed and open your journal to record exactly what transpired
    tonight.
  - Your mind brimming with new possibilities, you step inside and head upstairs.
    Slowly, you get undressed and open your journal to record exactly what transpired

  - Love and loss. Passion and transgression.
  - "You barely notice it when the carriage arrives at your home. Without interrupting
    you, Honorade signals to Ren\xE9. The coachman silently hops from his box at the
    head of the carriage and opens your door for you.\r"
  - Honorade offers her hand, to help you up as you get out of your seat. When you
    take her hand, you find yourself looking into her eyes.
  - "\u201CYvette, may I ask you to do something for me?\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhen I introduced myself earlier, I told you to call me Honorade. Now that
    I\u2019ve spoken with you a little more, I\u2019ve had a change of heart.\u201D\r"

  - "\u201CI would much prefer if you called me \u2018Madame Gazel\u2019, when you
    addressed me.\u201D "
  - "\u201CWould you be comfortable with that?\u201D"
  - '"<i>Merveilleuse</i>"'
  - "For a moment she seems disappointed, but quickly returns to normal. \u201CNo
    matter, it was a mere flight of fancy.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHopefully, we shall meet again soon. <i>Bonne nuit</i>, Yvette.\u201D She
    says to you before Ren\xE9 closes the carriage door. Soon, with a crack of his
