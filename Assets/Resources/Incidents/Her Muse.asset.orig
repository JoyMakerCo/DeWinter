  _nodeText:
  - "After your rendezvous, \xC9lisabeth offers to walk you home. The streets are
    empty, so you walk down the center of the road, arm in arm. While you can distantly
    hear the sound of the city's clamor from other streets, you feel like the only
    people in the world."
  - She does it again.
  - 'She laughs, and while it isn''t loud, it feels like a great pressure has been
    released.


    "Nothing''s wrong! I''m sorry, this isn''t normally a problem for me."'
  - 'The feeling in the air grows tenser. She stops and starts a few more times before
    she finally says it. '
  - '"Yvette, I... want to paint a new portrait, but not for a client. I want to make
    something more personal."'
  - '"I want to paint a new portrait, but not for a client. I want to make something
    more personal."'
  - '"Yvette, would you like to pose nude for me?"'
  - '"<i>Fantastique</i>!"'
  - '"Oh. That''s too bad."'
  - '"Well, not entirely. ''Nude'' and ''naked'' don''t mean the same thing in art."'
  - '"Naked portraits focus on realism, while nudity is about capturing the ideal."'
  - "She flushes with embarassment. \n\n\"No! That's not what I meant! I mean the
    painting isn't just about you being naked. It's about focusing on the ideal, to
    make a point.\""
  - '"... it might also be about you being naked."'
  - '"It''ll take a few sittings, but you can come by my studio whenever you like."'
  - '"I think we''ll both find this it very... inspiring." She flashes you a mischevious
    smile.


    The two of you walk and talk together for a while longer, but your mind is swimming
    with the possibilities of what you just agreed to.'
  - You get home, and pace around your room, feeling a combination of nervousness,
    excitement and exhaustion.
  - 'Your walk the rest of the way home is quiet, with a few attempts at conversation
    that don''t completely spring to life.


    Elisabeth seems distracted.'
  - When you get home, she gives you a wave goodbye and heads towards the main road.
  - Before you go to bed, you practice a few elegant poses in the mirror, imagining
    what it will be like to have your beauty immortalized by such an incredible artist.
  - You stare at yourself in the mirror before you go to bed, and hesitantly practice
    a few poses. The thought of someone staring at you naked, for hours at a time,
    does little to calm your nerves.
  - She glances at you and opens her mouth to speak, but stops and looks away.
  - Suddenly, she blurts it out. "Can you pose nude for me?"
  - The painting sessions can't come soon enough.
  - Fitfully, you manage to get to sleep.
  - 'In your room, you barely manage to get undressed before you collapse in your
    bed.


    This has been quite a day.'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Elisabeth)
  - ('The First Sitting' is now available to visit in the Paris map)
