  _nodeText:
  - You wake up and stretch, feeling a twinge in your back as you curse whatever contorted
    position you manage to fall asleep in last night. Judging from the noise outside,
    Paris has yet to become anymore peaceful during your night's rest.
  - Just as you wonder what Camille has prepared for your breakfast, you notice the
    faint smell of perfume. It's both floral and bitter.
  - There's a letter on the bedside table. Judging from the rich purple of the wax
    seal, as well as the scent of the perfume, it was definitely sent by Madame Gazel.
  - You open it, and begin the read the letter. The flowing cursive of her handwriting
    is both beautiful and familiar.
  - "\x18'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette,\n\nAs of late, I've been feeling even even better
    than I did at the beginning of our last fateful encounter. My gardens are doing
    especially well, and I'd love for you to see them.'"
  - '''Here, there will be no chance of us being interrupted. I await your arrival.'''
  - "<i>Bien affectueusement</i>,\n\nMadame Gazel\x19"
  - (The Mistress of Command is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - Fanning yourself with the letter to drive away some of the summer heat, you can't

    that you could go there tonight if you were willing to brave the streets of Paris.
