  - "Word has surfaced that \xC9lisabeth and Her Majesty, Queen Marie Antoinette are
    speaking with each other. Or, at least, engaging in correspondence via letters."
  - It's interesting that the public is taking the time to focus on this at all. Despite
    the Crown's power, the common people are still privately suspicious of their their
    foreign born Queen.
  - To her credit, Her Majesty the Queen has pointedly avoided affairs of state, choosing
    instead to focus on raising her children and lounging about her personal palace,
    <i>Petit Trianon</i>. However, ever since she started recieving these letters,
    something has changed.
  - It's not surprising that the public is choosing to focus on this. Most commoners
    absolutely detest the Queen for a host of reasons, though some of these reasons
    are less sensible than others.
  - "The Queen has suddenly pushed for \xC9lisabeth to be commisioned to paint a variety
    of portraits for various members of court, as well as some of her relatives. This
    sudden turn of fortune honestly doesn't paint \xC9lisabeth in the best light,
    but hopefully she's happy.\n\n"
  - '(The Crown has gained a little power)

    (The Revolution has lost a little power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - "The Queen's not only been exchanging more letters with Elisabeth, she's also
    been making more trips into Paris. The news is mostly social pablum, but you're
    certain that \xC9lisabeth is at least happy about these changes."
  - '(The Crown has lost a little power)

    (The Revolution has gained a little power)'
  - If there's one thing you've learned in the last few months, it's that once the
    public hates someone, they insatiably crave news about that person. No matter
    how angry it makes them, they will thirstily gulp it down like a drunk, gleefully
    slurping up poison from any souce they can find.
  - However, this all comes with the side effect of creating a general feeling that
    the members of royalty don't actually... do anything.
  - However, this all comes with the side effect of making the Crown feel powerful
    and culturally relevant, at least for a litle while.
