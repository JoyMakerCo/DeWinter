  _nodeText:
  - Last night, a sleepy commune named Varennes made history.
  - 'The last few years have been a collection of sporadic uprisings and unsuccessful
    battles as revolutionary forces spring up across the country, lead by men like
    Robespierre, Lafayette, and Talleyrand. '
  - For the last few years, the king and his family have been confined to <i>Tuileries</i>,
    their palace in Paris, in order to keep them under the close watch of revolutionary
    leadership.
  - 'Last night, the royal family disguised themselves, escaped their guards, and
    took a carriage headed to France''s border with the Austrain Netherlands. '
  - However, over a hundred miles into their journey, their plan was undone. The king,
    who was disguised as a servant, was unmasked by a local post-master who recognized
    His Majesty's face from a royal seal.
  - It has come to light that His Majesty and his family were fleeing towards a citadel
    containing over ten thousand troops still loyal to the Crown. Their plan was to
    amass a counter-revolutionary army.
  - Their many narrow escapes from royalist forces have become the stuff of folk legends,
    and several fictional accounts have already been publihsed in the form of illegally
    disitributed novels.
  - 'However, one''s luck can only last so long, and the revolutionary leaders were
    finally cornered, found hiding in the attic of the Varennes post office. '
  - 'With their leaders apprehended and brought back to Paris in chains, the remaining
    revolutionary forces scattered across France have been left demoralized and leaderless. '
  - As the king has his family were escorted back to Paris, they were greeted without
    cheers, and without jeers. Instead, for the first time in their lives, they were
    greeted only with silence. Any sympathy that once remained for them amongst the
    common people has gone.
  - And so, Paris continues to burn.
