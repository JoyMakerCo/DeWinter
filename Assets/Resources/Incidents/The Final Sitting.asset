  - "It takes a little longer than before to get to \xC9lisabeth's studio today. There's
    no special event, the streets are simply crowded with throngs of people going
    about their daily business. \n\nYou resist the urge to scream and shove them out
    of your way, but just barely."
  - Still, you manage to arrive at the painting studio without incident or injury.
  - Still thinking of the myriad people who wouldn't get out of your way on the walk
    over here, you knock sharply on the door.
  - "Keeping \xC9lisabeth's previous requests for discretion in mind, you let yourself
    into her studio. A cool breeze sweeps through the open windows, rustling the cloth
    that covers the painting-in-progress."
  - "\"Ah, it's great to see you!\" \xC9lisabeth says as she strides into the room,
    already dressed to paint. \"Shall we get started? I'm just itching to work.\""
  - "The door creaks open and you can see \xC9lisabeth's angry face on the other side."
  - "With what has become a practiced ease, you disrobe and take your position on
    the satin couch. \xC9lisabeth takes the cover off of your portrait and starts
    preparing her paints. "
  - At this stage, she's focusing on specific details of your portrait. Ocassionally,
    she asks for you to minutely shift parts of your body this way and that.
  - '"I wasn''t sure you''d even agree to even pose for me. Nudes tend to make clients
    nervous."'
  - "\"Oh really, you trust me?\" \xC9lisabeth asks with an arched eyebrow. She's
    trying to remain aloof, but you can tell that she's actually a little touched."
  - "\xC9lisabeth doesn't say anything for a while, but instead shifts uncomfortably
    at her easel."
  - "\xC9lisabeth puts down her brush for a moment and laughs into the back of her
    hand. \"Oh really, is that so?\""
  - '"Now, I need you to stop being so funny for a moment, I can''t be gigling during
    some of these more precise details." The artist says with a mock sternness. '
  - '"Of course not, this is just for me... and you."'
  - "With nothing more than a contented smile, \xC9lisabeth returns to her painting,
    still glancing up at you on ocassiona before squinting down at some particular
    detail."
  - Elisabeth returns to her painting, still glancing up at you at regular intervals
    before squinting down at some particular detail.
  - "Another hour passes, and you take a break to stand up and stretch. Even with
    your relaxed pose on the couch, all of that time spent staying exactly still starts
    to wear on you. \n\nYou return back to your position, and \xC9lisabeth to her
    art."
  - Later, you find yourself shifting on the couch again. This has been quite a long
    session.
  - "\"Oh, what?\" \xC9lisabeth asks, standing up from her canvas."
  - "You silently roll your shoulders and resettle into your pose. You're not positioned
    to look at \xC9lisabeth directly, but out of the corner of your eye you can see
    her leaning away from the canvas to examine you."
  - You squint as you notice that her brush hand hasn't moved in an awfully long time.
  - "Finally, \xC9lisabeth stands up from her easel with a laugh. \"I'm sorry Yvette,
    but I've been done over half an hour ago.\" \n\nShe favors you with a sly grin.
    \"I just enjoy looking at you like this.\""
  - She gets up from her easel and walks over to you. "You must be very cold."
  - Her finger traces down the outside of your thigh. "How'd you like to warm up?"
  - "\"Well, the client is always right.\" She replies with a smirk. \n\nWith the
    rustling sound of skirts, \xC9lisabeth kneels on the couch and places a hand on
    the armrest behind you. Gently, she leans forward over you. You crane your neck
    until your lips meet."
  - '"Fair enough, I''ll fetch us some refreshements. You must be famished."


    Before you can reply, the rumbling of your stomach speaks for you.'
  - You have to admit, she is very warm.
  - 'Some time later, after taking the time to fix your hair and slip back into your
    foundation garments, you''re taking tea and pastries with Elisabeth.


    They taste amazing, but that might just be because you''re famished. '
  - "While \xC9lisabeth is out fetching said refreshments, you take the time to slip
    back into your foundation garments. You keep your stays tied loosely, because
    you'd hate to get in the way of your own appetite. "
  - "The two of you lounge and chat about the painting for some time. You pace about
    the studio while you talk, relishing the chance to stretch your limbs after all
    this time.\n\nEventually it gets late enough that the two of you have to say your
    goodbyes. \xC9lisabeth helps you back into your dress. "
  - Outside, you walk home. Compared to the nightmarish hustle and bustle of before,
    the streets feel almost abandoned. You stroll alone, completely lost in your own
    thoughts.
  - You arrive home, still unsure of how you feel.
  - 'Feeling buoyed by the heady thrills of love, you ascend to your bedroom on light
    feet, and prepare yourself for bed. '
  - She grabs you by the wrist and pulls you inside.
  - "\xC9lisabeth stops to breathe quietly, slowly regaining her composure. One of
    her hands plays with the edge of the canvas apron she's wearing over her dress.
    \"Ok, I'm fine now. Shall we get started? I'm just itching to work!\""
  - '"Sorry, I must have finished up half an hour ago." She says with a sly grin.
    "I just enjoy looking at you like this."'
  - "\"Oh, I almost forgot!\" \xC9lisabeth giggles. \"I should probably show you the
    painting that you've been sitting for, all of this time.\"\n\nWith a burst of
    fresh energy she gets up and walks over to her easel."
  - 'She turns around the canvas and you see your future. '
  - 'She turns around the canvas and you see yourself. '
  - She turns around the canvas and you see yourself. Well, not just yourself.
  - It's obvious that a tremendous amount of work has gone into this painting. If
    you squint closely, you can see places where the oil paints have been layered
    and layered, the result of endless attempts to get some tiny detail just right.
    It's a labor of love and it shows.
  - "\"It was really brave of you to ask me to paint you honestly, and I'm proud of
    the results.\" \xC9lisabeth smiles, regarding the painting with her hands on her
    hips."
  - "\"I hope you like it.\" \xC9lisabeth says sheepishly. \"I wanted to make sure
    that it still feels like you.\""
  - Putting down her paints and removing her apron, she walks over to you. "You must
    be very cold."
  - "(You have earned a large amount of favor with \xC9lisabeth, but you probably
    already knew that, didn't you?)"
  - "When \xC9lisabeth returns with the tea and pastries, you waste no time in digging
    in. They taste amazing, but of course, hunger has always been the sweetest spice."
  - '"I can''t wait to get this framed and hung up in my collection."'
  - 'With a grin of triumph, and a mind aflame with possibility, you practically dance
    up the stairs to your bedroom. You can''t help but spend a few minutes practicing
    regal faces in your vanity''s mirror before you turn down for the night. '
  - 'Burdened with internal turmoil, you ascend to your bedroom with a heavy tread.
    Wearily, you prepare yourself for bed. '
  - Everywhere you look in the painting, you are struck by an uncanny perfection that
    reminds you that what you are seeing isn't real. Yet.
  - "\xC9lisabeth takes a deep breath, and her next words are almost a sigh of relief.
    \"I'm really proud of this one. I can't wait to get it framed and hung up in my
    collection.\""
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - '"Yvette, if this is a joke, it''s not funny. You know my situation." She hisses
    at you, making significant glances to the shapes of the servants in the windows
    above.'
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - New Moment
  - "You asked \xC9lisabeth to give you perfection and she delivered it unto you.
    Every beauty has been refined, and every flaw erased. You may be nude in the painting,
    but you feel as regal as any monarch laden with jewels, silks, and ermine."
  - "It's \xC9lisabeth's version of you, and while she isn't in the portrait itself,
    you can see so much of her personality in the painting. You look relaxed and confident,
    but adorned with an enigmatic smile and eyes that seems to be looking somewhere
    else. "
  - The image is surprising, but in an interesting way. You aren't unattractive by
    any stretch of the imagination, but like most people you often gloss over the
    details of your own features, preferring the image you see in your head. You almost
    want to disagree with it.
  - 'It makes you think the way the best pieces of art do. It is a beautiful portrait,
    in that way that only the unadulterated truth can achieve. '
