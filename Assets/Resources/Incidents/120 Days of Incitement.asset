  - The Bastille, a towering castle in the middle of Paris. A symbol of the <i>ancien
    regime's</i> power. These days, it's used to store weapons, ammunition, and prisoners
    that the Crown finds particularly undesirable.
  - One such prisoner is the infamous Marquis de Sade, a libertine, pro-revolutionary
    writer who belives in absolute freedom. Freedom from tyranny, freedom from religion,
    freedom from morality itself.
  - Fortunately for the guards, those listening to his claims have realized that the
    person yelling such claims of mistreatment is the infamous Marquis de Sade, and
    steadfastly ignored him. His continued pleas and claims have made the Revolutionaries
    look ridiculous.
  - These claims have reached enough sympathetic ears that it's caused an uproar of
    idignation amongst the public. The prison commander has found himself under an
    official investigation as a result, and the Military command in charge of the
    Bastille now look like fools.
  - (The Military has lost a little power)
  - Later on, the commander of the Bastille reached the end of his patience and had
    the Marquis transferred to a new asylum. According to the newspaper the mad nobleman
    was 'as naked as a worm' when he was led from the building.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - He has also written a staggering amount of pornography. Extremely... unconventional
    pornography.
  - He claims that prisoners are being secretly executed within the prison, but there's
    no evidence as to whether this is actually true, or not.
  - (The Revolution has lost a little power)
  - Later on, the commander of the Bastille reached the end of his patience and had
    the Marquis transferred to a new asylum. According to the newspaper the mad nobleman
    was 'as naked as a worm' when he was led from the building.
  - 'The last decade has seen him being shuffled between various asylums, and he now
    resides in the Bastille. These days, he spends all of his time writing, but has
    recently started calling out the windows to anyone that might listen. '
  - It's believed that this act of public exposure was intended to humiliate him,
    but instead the smiling libertine claimed that he found the experience to be both
    enjoyable and enlightening. Something that he yelled quite clearly to any nearby
    reporters.
  - Apparently, this has had a diminishing effect on the ferocity of his outbursts.
