  - "You notice the painter \xC9lisabeth and decide to chat with her. However, before
    you manage to approach her, she glances about and quickly leaves the room."
  - Confused but unperturbed, you follow her outside into the gardens.
  - 'Approaching her, you survey the area and it seems that there''s nobody else out
    here, except for you two.


    Unless...'
  - Your heartbeat quickens when you notice shapes that might be following you, until
    you realize that it's a young couple giggling furtively between themselves, as
    they disappear together into a hedgemaze. It's safe to assume that they'll be
    occupied with that for a while.
  - "Well, now you're alone with \xC9lisabeth."
  - When you finally catch up with her, she's circling a tree, staring pensively into
    it's branches.
  - "\xC9lisabeth looks over at you and laughs distractedly. \"I suppose it is quite
    beautiful.\""
  - She looks at you, both confused and exasperated. "What? No, I didn't even know
    that you were there! It's just that..."
  - '"Oh, <i>bon soir</i>," She says, suddenly noticing you. "Some help would be very
    much appreciated, actually."'
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - '"My daughter Julie wanted to come with me tonight, so I brought her, but then
    I ran into a potential client. I must have gotten so distracted setting up a meeting
    with him that I stopped paying attention to her. She must have gotten bored and
    wandered off."'
  - '"However, I''m looking for something other than natural beauty at the moment."'
  - '"I know how much she likes climbing trees, and a few moments ago, I''m certain
    that I saw her little legs scurrying up this one. Now that I''m out here though,
    I can''t see her at all."'
  - '"Ugh! Now I know why she was so insistent on wearing that dark green dress tonight." '
  - '"Here is some parenting advice: never spend an evening teaching your curious
    and precocious daughter about color theory. Apparently, all she''ll learn from
    it is how to camoflague herself."'
  - "\"I shouldn't have brought her here.\" \xC9lisabeth says, frustrated and defeated."
  - She sighs, "You're probably right."
  - She sighs. "<i>Merci beaucoup</i>. It's nice to know that at least someone here
    thinks I'm doing the right thing."
  - '"What? I did it because... because... <i>merde</i>! I just don''t know!"'
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - '"I always attend these things by myself, because I''m really here to find new
    clients to paint."'
  - '"Unfortunately, little Julie doesn''t really understand that. She just knows
    <i>maman</i> is going to another fancy ball with all the Queens and Princesses.
    Every time she begs me to let her come along."'
  - She shakes her head and looks up at the tree again. "Why are children always so
    eager to grow up?"
  - '"Well, she asked me again today, and I let her win. I thought that maybe she
    was old enough. Now I can''t find new clients, and my own daughter probably thinks
    my life is stupid and boring."'
  - 'You stand there and try to think of something to say, but you honestly found
    your parents'' own lives pretty boring yourself. That''s part of the reason you''re
    even here.


    However, you''re saved by the sound of rustling branches overhead.'
  - '"<i>Maman</i>! I''m thirsty!" Says a voice from up in the tree.'
  - '"Jeanne-Lucie-Louise Le Brun! Is that you up there?"'
  - "\xC9lisabeth nudges you. \"At least I'm not alone while making foolish my mistakes.\""
  - '"I did it because I''m a fool."'
  - '"Uh... <i>non</i>. I am just a bird."'
  - '"A bird who is thirsty."'
  - '"<i>Mon dieu</i>! Julie, do you have any idea how worried I was? Come down here
    right now! I swear I will climb up there, if I have to." She says, slowly hiking
    up her skirt.'
  - "It might be a good idea to intervene, before \xC9lisabeth is caught scaling a
    tree."
  - '"Alright, fine!" Replies the petulant voice of a child who knows they don''t
    have any other choices.'
  - '"No you wouldn''t!" Jeers back the child, quick to test your patience. He mother
    wouldn''t cut down this tree with her still in it.'
  - '"What? There''s a Queen''s cake?"'
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "With her daughter finally secured and accounted for, \xC9lisabeth heads inside
    to the rest of the party in order to find some cake that looks suitably royal.
    You're left to your own devices, and decide to head inside as well, before the
    couple that disappeared into the hedgemaze starts making too much noise."
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "Oh, there are tears, now. \n\nYou may have laid this on a little too strong."
  - 'Elisabeth sighs, and starts comforting her safe, but upset child. It may take
    the rest of the evening for her to calm Julie down. '
  - "\"I mean, it's covered in special icing, and honey flowers that you're not allowed
    to have anywhere else, but maybe you're just not old enough for it...\" \xC9lisabeth
    chimes in."
  - "Julie scurries down the tree and returns to her mother. \xC9lisabeth mouths a
    silent 'Thank you' to you, while she cleans some twigs and dirt off of her errant
    daughter's dress.."
  - "Julie scurries down the tree and returns to her mother. \xC9lisabeth mouths a
    silent 'Thank you' to you, while she cleans some twigs and dirt off of her errant
    daughter's dress.."
  - "With her daughter finally secured and accounted for, \xC9lisabeth heads inside
    to the rest of the party. You're left to your own devices, and decide to head
    inside as well, before the couple that disappeared into the hedgemaze starts making
    too much noise."
  - Your response is silence, and a flinty expression that serves as a stern reminder
    that you are not her mother.
  - With a cry, Julie quickly scurries down the street and into the arms of her waiting
    mother.
  - '"No! Wait! I''m coming!"'
