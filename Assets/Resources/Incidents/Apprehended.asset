  - 'The next few moments are a blur. '
  - "The watchman grabs you by the wrist, his calloused hand feels like a vice. You
    pull back and scream in shock. Alarmed by the sound, more of the watchmen\u2019s
    compatriots appear. "
  - "Accusations are shouted. A sergeant with breath that stinks of cheap wine demands
    to know who you\u2019re working for, his fat fingers dangerously close to your
    face. Everything starts getting louder and more chaotic with every passing moment. "
  - The watchman grabs you by the wrist. Hansel grabs him by the throat. People start
    screaming. More watchmen appear. Everything starts getting louder and more chaotic
    with every passing moment.
  - "An hour later, you\u2019re sitting alone in a dark cell back at the Guet Royal\u2019s
    watch post. You\u2019re not sure what you\u2019ve been charged with, but this
    whole situation is obviously less than ideal. \n\nSomewhere else in the watch
    post, a pickpocket is screaming about his innocence. His alibi is getting more
    creative with every passing moment."
  - The hours pass until morning. You feel nothing, other than the truly stultifying
    boredom of being locked in a stone box by yourself. At least it's enough time
    for people to forget about your more indiscreet actions.
  - "You feel yourself being jostled in the sudden melee like a piece of flotsam in
    a turbulent river. You try to find an exit, a way to flee, but it\u2019s a struggle
    just to stay standing."
  - "An hour later, you\u2019re sitting alone in a dark cell back at the Guet Royal\u2019s
    watch post. You\u2019re not sure what you\u2019ve been charged with, but this
    is obviously less than ideal. \n\nHansel\u2019s been placed in a seperate cell,
    but you can hear him cursing to himself in German occasionally, so you know he\u2019s
    fine."
  - That morning turns to night. Meals are pushed through a slot in the door, and
    you do your best to stomach the lumpy, tasteless food. While you could refuse
    to eat out of spite, you get the feeling that the guards would barely notice.
  - Your malaise is suddenly interrupted by the distant sound of a commotion, followed
    by the enraged shouts of a familiar voice...
  - "The next day, you bang at the cell door to ask what you\u2019ve been charged
    with. One of the watchmen says he\u2019ll go find out, but you never hear from
    him again. The others don\u2019t even bother to answer you."
  - "That night, you wake up to find the fatest rat you\u2019ve ever seen crawling
    on your leg and trying to eat your shoes. With a few choice words and some shakes
    of your leg, you manage to shoo it away. \n\nThe obese thing squeaks indignantly
    at you before waddling away and squeezing into a hole in the wall."
  - "The next morning, you are so bored that you have decided to name the rat. His
    name is Fran\xE7ois-Louis, and he is a successful restauranteur in the rat community.
    He hoped to serve your shoes to his patrons as a lavish delicacy.\n\nYou can\u2019t
    wait to get out of here."
  - 'You dream fitfully that night, your sleeping mind trying to compensate for your
    lack of waking activity by bombarding you with every colorful and outlandish imagery
    imaginable. At least one of them is a fat rat in a waistcoat. '
  - The morning of the third day, the door opens.
  - "\u201CAlright madame, you\u2019re free to go.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI mean, we can keep you here for longer, but we\u2019d have to start charging
    rent,\u201D the watchman replies with a shrug. \u201CWe looked into your background
    and it doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re an enemy of the crown. You were just
    trespassing, and it felt like three days in a cell was enough.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat were you charged with?\u201D the watchman asks, indignant at any attempt
    to question his authority. He scowls, and begins to stretch the limits of his
    imagination. \u201CWell, you were trespassing and\u2026\u201D \n\nIt\u2019s an
    impressive effort, with unimpressive results."
  - "\u201C... and trespassing. We didn\u2019t find anything stolen, and you didn\u2019t
    really do anything else. So after three days, you\u2019re free to go!\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat is the meaning of this? You\u2019re keeping a lost and vulnerable
    Christian woman in need of guidance, amongst this loathsome squalor? Have you
    no shame?\u201D"
  - "\u201CNo, I shall not be calm! In the name of Saint Nicholas of Myra, you will
    turn this lost soul over to my care! You will do this for the sake of her soul,
    and dare I say, for you own!\u201D"
  - The shouting continues for a little while longer until you hear the jingling of
    keys, and the creaking of the door being unlocked.
  - "\u201CHere she is, Father Sidotti,\u201D the watchman sighs. He looks like he
    just wants this entire ordeal to be over."
  - "\u201CHere she is, Father Sidotti,\u201D the watchman sighs. He looks like he
    just wants this entire ordeal to be over. \u201CHer associate is being held a
    few cells over, will you be needing that one too?\u201D "
  - "\u201CLeave us, my son,\u201D Ludovico commands, his voice steely and stern."
  - "With a weary nod, the watchman leaves the room and shuts the door behind himself.
    \n\nYou don\u2019t hear the door lock."
  - "\u201CI have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect us to meet again under these circumstances.\u201D
    Ludovico says with a mischievous grin."
  - Ludovico smiles at your reply, and for a moment he looks you up and down in silence.
  - "\u201CIf by \u2018power\u2019, you mean \u2018the watchmen can\u2019t make me
    leave, and giving up a minor criminal is better than having me stand in their
    post loudly abjuring their immortal souls all day\u2019 then yes, I have that
    power.\u201D"
  - "\u201COne of my many duties in the city is visiting prisoners for confessionals.
    After all, those who\u2019ve fallen into wickedness are the ones who need our
    Lord\u2019s guidance the most.\u201D He gestures to the Bible in his hands. It\u2019s
    well cared for but also well worn, without any gilding or ornamentation. "
  - "\u201CYes, I will be collecting her hireling as well. Leave us, my son,\u201D
    Ludovico commands, his voice steely and stern. "
  - "With a weary nod, the watchman leaves the room and shuts the door behind himself.
    \n\nYou don\u2019t hear the door lock."
  - "\u201CI have to admit, I didn\u2019t expect us to meet again under these circumstances.\u201D
    Ludovico says with a mischievous grin."
  - "\u201CWell, you see <i>signora</i>, I must admit that I\u2019ve never had to
    deal with a case as\u2026 interesting as your own. I think we\u2019d have to see
    each other quite a lot before I found some kind of solution.\u201D"
  - "\u201CBut I would rather have this conversation somewhere less\u2026 dank and
    depressing.\u201D Ludovico gestures towards the door. \u201CAfter you, Yvette.\u201D"
  - "Outside, you breathe deeply, tasting fresh air for the first time in a while.
    It\u2019s a simply pleasure, but one you already missed. The city continues in
    its daily routine, as if nothing had even happened. "
  - "\u201CYour freedom, Yvette, has been delivered unto you.\u201D Ludovico pronounces,
    with a dramatic sweep of his hands, before continuing. \u201CWhile I would absolutely
    love to stay with you and help you celebrate it, I unfortunately have a lot more
    prisons to visit before the day is up.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI find that the best way to deal with the powerful is make myself a balance
    of \u2018helpful samaritan\u2019 and \u2018irritating nuisance\u2019. If they
    give me what I want, then I solve one of their problems, and they don\u2019t have
    to deal with me anymore. I get what I want, and they still get to feel like they
    won.\u201D He says idly, examining your cell."
  - "\u201CI could go on, but I would rather have this conversation somewhere less\u2026
    dank and depressing.\u201D Ludovico gestures towards the door. \u201CAfter you,
    Yvette.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI also find that knowing what the criminals are up to is a great way to
    understand what\u2019s really happening in a city.\u201D Ludovico admits with
    a shrug. \u201CThis allows my letters to Rome be a little more\u2026 complete.\u201D"
  - "He turns to you with a wry smile. \u201CNow imagine my surprise, when on my way
    to tend to the souls of the thugs and cutpurses of the <i>7th Arrondissement</i>,
    I happen to see your name among the roll of prisoners.\u201D"
  - "\u201CObviously, you couldn\u2019t possibly be guilty of any crime, so I decided
    to intercede,\u201D he says with a wink."
  - "\u201CAnd yet with all of this knowledge, I\u2019m still hoping to know you better.\u201D "
  - "\u201CBut please, I would rather have this conversation somewhere less\u2026
    dank and depressing.\u201D Ludovico gestures towards the door. \u201CAfter you,
    Yvette.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI wouldn\u2019t say \u2018random chance\u2019. After all, the Lord works
    in mysterious ways.\u201D Ludovico replies with a shrug. "
  - "\u201CYour freedom, has been delivered unto you, Yvette.\u201D Ludovico pronounces,
    with a dramatic sweep of his hands."
  - "\u201CMay we meet again soon, under better circumstances.\u201D Ludovico says,
    with a slow and polite nod of his head. You reply with the appropriate curtsey."
  - "Ludovico quickly disappears into the crowds, and you are left alone. A few gawkers
    note your bedraggled state and you can easily assume that the fact that you just
    spent a night in a jail cell is going to make it to all the right people.\n\nYou
    take some comfort in knowing that at least you\u2019re not in prison anymore."
  - You start the walk home, already relishing the idea of a hot meal, a long bath,
    and a fresh change of clothes.
  - "Ludovico turns to Hansel \u201CIt has also been delivered unto you\u2026 <i>Singore</i>...\u201D"
  - "\u201CMy name is Hansel, Father.\u201D Hansel replies gruffly. \u201CI am Madame
    Decaux\u2019s doorman.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHer dooman?\u201D Ludovico asks, his eyes resting on Hansel\u2019s recently
    returned sword."
  - "\u201C<i>Ja</i>. The city has many doors. Some of them are more dangerous than
    others. Madame Decaux pays me to make sure they\u2019re opened, or kept shut.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI see!\u201D Ludovico replies, clapping his hands together as if that just
    answered everything. \u201CWhile I would absolutely love to stay, I unfortunately
    have a lot more prisons to visit before the day is up. May we meet again soon,
    under better circumstances.\u201D Ludovico says, with a slow and polite nod of
    his head. You reply with the appropriate curtsey. Hansel gives a grunt of appreciation."
  - "Ludovico disappears into the crowds, leaving you and Hansel alone. A few gawkers
    note your bedraggled state and you can easily assume that the fact that you just
    spent a night in a jail cell is going to make it to all the right people.\n\nYou
    take some comfort in knowing that at least you\u2019re not in prison anymore."
  - "With neither a chastisement nor an apology, you\u2019re lead out onto the street,
    and the door of the watch post is shut loudly behind you. Just like that, you\u2019re
    free. "
  - A few gawkers note your bedraggled state and you can easily assume that the fact
    that you just spent a few days in a jail cell is going to make it to all the right
    people.
  - You start the walk home, already relishing the idea of a hot meal, a long bath,
    and a fresh change of clothes
  - "Without so much as an apology, you\u2019re lead out onto the street, and the
    door of the watch post is slammed loudly behind you. A few gawkers note your bedraggled
    state and you can easily assume that the fact that you just spent a few days in
    a jail cell is going to make it to all the right people."
  - You start the walk home, already relishing the idea of a hot meal, a long bath,
    and a fresh change of clothes.
  - '(You have lost quite a bit of credibility)

    (You ahve lost some favor with everyone)'
  - '(You have lost quite a bit of credibility)

    (You have lost some favor with everyone, but Ludovico)'
  - (You have lost a staggering amount of peril)
