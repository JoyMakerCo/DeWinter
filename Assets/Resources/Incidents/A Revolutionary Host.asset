  - "You approach a woman who\u2019s standing by herself. She\u2019s looking around
    at the party, and just seems extremely pleased to be here.\r\n\r\n\u201CIsn\u2019t
    this magnificent?\u201D She beams. \u201CSo many revolutionary minds in one place,
    all brought together by one man.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CHow do you know our host, Baron Maximin de Termes?\u201D She asks."
  - "\x1C\"Really?\"\x1D She asks, her voice dropping to a low whisper. \x1C\"I don\x19t
    mean to be rude, but I\x19've never seen you before, and I attend many of the
    salons.\x1D\r\""
  - It appears that nothing would please her more.
  - "\u201COh, Baron Maximin de Termes is a cut apart from the rest of the nobility!
    He host salons, sponsors pamphlet printings, and associates with our heroes who
    fought in the American War for Independence.\u201D She clasps her hands together
    and gazes off into the distance.\r"
  - "\u201COf course, he has made a few enemies. The Baron has already had to denounce
    some of his associates for not properly embodying revolutionary ideals. Thankfully,
    his reputation has only thrived because of his bravery!\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIsn\u2019t he wonderful?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, he most certainly is!\u201D She replies happily.\r\n\r\nYou get the
    feeling that her interest in the Baron strays beyond the strictly ideological,
    but that\u2019s none of your business.\r"
  - "Her expression immediately sours.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, that\u2019s not how I would
    have put it, but I suppose one could say that\u2026\u201D"
  - "You two talk and joke for a while, and eventually part ways. If you get a chance
    to speak with the Baron de Termes, you\u2019re absolutely certain that you\u2019ll
    have a lot to talk about."
  - The next few minutes pass in awkward silence, punctuated only by bouts of glaring
    and the occasional upturned nose. Eventually, you walk away to explore the rest
    of the party.
  - "\u201CThen again...\" She continues with uncertainty. \"I know the Baron also
    hosts his own private gatherings like this one, and this is my first. That makes
    so much sense, I\u2019m sorry for doubting you. I had no idea you were so familiar
    with the Baron.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CPerhaps later, you would be able to introduce us?\u201D She asks, with
    some trepidation. \u201CI\u2019m sure he and I would have a lot to\u2026 discuss.\u201D"
  - "The two of you chat and joke for a while. During the course of conversation,
    you maintain the lie so flawlessly that, for a brief moment, you have to remind
    yourself that you don\u2019t actually know the Baron. "
  - "Eventually, the two of you part ways to explore the rest of the party.\r"
  - "\u201CIn fact, the only way this could be true, is if we had attended all the
    events the other one had missed, for years. Which would be convenient indeed!\"
    She replies cheerily. \"\x1CSince we'\x19ve exclusively attended such different
    events, I have some helpful advice for you.\x1D\r\""
  - "\u201CDon\u2019t lie about your relationship to the host. Maximin has no time
    for the ridiculous intrigues of courtiers, and I\u2019m sure he would certainly
    not appreciate this, if he were to find out.\u201D\r"
  - You manage to mumble a few polite words of thanks before you decide to slink away.
  - "\x1CThe Estates General hasn\x19t even convened yet, but he\x19s already expressed
    his support for the Third Estate and a new, enlightened France.\x1D \r"
  - "(You have lost some credibility)\r\n(You have gained a little peril)\r"
  - "(You have gained some credibility)\r"
