  _nodeText:
  - "Following the events at R\xE9veillon's factory, a general air of tension feels
    like it has blanketed all of Paris. Rumors of imagined violence swirl at every
    turn, threatening to incite real violence. "
  - 'This reached a new peak yesterday when several members of the nobility in the
    city woke up to find the letter ''P'' painted in black on their front doors. It''s
    believed that the letter stood for ''proscribed'', marking the occupants for death
    to some group of assassins. '
  - "However, said assassins never materialized, and it didn't take long for the <i>Guet
    Royal</i> to track down the vandals responsible, and extract some confessions.
    \n\nThese empty threats from the dissidents have only served to make the aristocracy
    seem more powerful and untouchable."
  - "Though nobody has actually been killed yet, this was still enough to incite a
    panic. In turn this has served to highlight just how vulnerable the nobility really
    are. \n\nNo matter how wealthy and powerful someone is, a dagger in the dark renders
    all men equal. "
  - '(The Crown has lost a little power)

    (The Revolution has gained a little power)'
  - '(The Crown has gained a little power)

    (The Revolution has lost a little power)'
  - And so, life in Paris goes on.
