  _nodeText:
  - Back home, you finally pull the note and key out from under your stays. Unfamiliar
    handwriting written in rich, emerald ink.
  - '''<i>Cher</i> Armand,


    I will always appreciate your commitment to our cause, and I know France will
    be better for it. However, our chance of being caught grows with every passing
    day. I will not waste ink painting terrible pictures of the consequences, as you
    are already familiar with them.'''
  - "\u2018If fortune turns against us, then I want you to flee Paris entirely, and
    head to the border. If you show them my ring then my society's sponsors will protect
    you. I know you\u2019ve objected to this idea before, but it\u2019s the only way
    for you to stay safe. To aid in this, I\u2019ve secreted a package under the loose
    floorboards beneath your stove. This key will open it.\u2019\n\nYou look at the
    key. It\u2019s still here, so Armand never received the note."
  - "\u2018Your partner in conspiracy,\n\nJohanna\u2019"
  - "You turn over the letter and find no additional writing, no additional context
    or explanation. \n\nWho is Johanna? How long has Armand known her for? Is she
    one of the people he\u2019d been writing back home?"
  - "Heading downstairs, you walk into the kitchen. It\u2019s clean but cramped, and
    Camille keeps it well stocked with fresh produce. You find the stove, made of
    dark iron and standing on a set of clawed feet. \n\nAlone, on your hands and knees,
    you feel around until you find a set of loose floorboards."
  - 'You pull up the floorboards and fish around in the dark until you find a small
    wooden box, held shut by a padlock. You open it with the key you found behind
    the painting. '
  - Inside the box you find a magnetic compass, a map of Paris with notes concerning
    when the guards change at every one of the city gates, a signet ring, and a leather
    bag heavy with coins.
  - "You look inside the bag\u2026 that\u2019s a lot of coins.\n\n(You have gained
    100 Livres!)"
  - You look up from your sudden windfall to see Camille standing in the doorway to
    the kitchen. Her eyes are darting between you and the box in confusion.
  - "\"I was just about to start making lunch\u2026\" Camille says, pointing awkwardly
    at the stove."
  - "\"Kn-know about what?\" Camille asks, glancing between you and the bag of coins
    in your hands. \"Was that Monsieur Armand\u2019s? Why would he leave money in
    the house?\""
  - "\"Madame, what\u2019s going on?\""
  - "\"I never asked anyone\u2019s names, madame.\u201D Camille admits, looking downcast.
    \u201CSo many of Monsieur Armand\u2019s guests valued their privacy, that I wanted
    to give them a polite amount space.\""
  - '"However..." Camille straightens up, tapping her finger on her chin. "There was
    a woman who came by more frequently than the other guests. She had brown hair,
    and a scar on her chin.

    I remember her because she always wore a silver necklace, with the prettiest emerald
    in the center of it."'
  - You look down at the green ink used the write the note to Armand. Is there are
    a connection?
  - "\"That\u2019s all I can remember madame. Now\u2026 if I may ask, can I have the
    kitchen to myself? I\u2019d like to start making your lunch.\""
  - (You have gained 100 Livres)
  - (You have lost quite a bit of peril)
  - (You have given away 25 Livres)
  - The notes on the map will make it much easier to traverse the city without being
    noticed, by the <i>Guet Royal</i>, or by anyone else.
  - For the first time since you've met her, you feel like Camille might not be telling
    the truth.
  - '"Why did he leave?" She asks nervously.'
  - '"A few weeks ago, when Monsieur Armand still lived here... some men came here
    in the middle of the night. I don''t know why but they tried to hurt him." Camille
    says, her voice low and afraid. "I was in the cellar getting wine, so I hid down
    there in the dark until the screaming stopped."'
  - '"Madame, I simply don''t know what you''re talking about." Camille replies in
    a rush, fidgeting with her apron.'
  - Before you can ask any further questions, Camille ushers you out, into the hallway.
    The door shuts quickly behind you and all you can hear is the clattering of pots
    and pans as she starts furiously preparing food.
  - '"Now, I still have to make you lunch, so I''m going to have to ask you to leave
    the kitchen."'
  - 'You look over the signet ring that was included in the box. It''s a finely made
    silver ring with a signet used for pressing seals in wax. You don''t recognize
    the symbol on the ring, but the piece of jewelry itself looks very old. '
  - '"Monsieur Armand managed to fight them off, but he was hurt and thought that
    these men would come back for him. So, packed his things, wrote the note for you,
    and left. He thought that if he wasn''t here, they''d keep chasing after him and
    you''d be safe."'
  - '"I was supposed to tell you what happened, but this house is just so big and
    empty... by the time you arrived, I was so lonely. I was afraid that if you knew
    the whole story then you''d leave, and I''d be alone again."'
  - '"I''m so sorry madame! I never wanted to lie to you. I just... I just..."'
  - '"<i>Merci beaucoups</i>!" She yelps in relief. "I promise to never keep anything
    from you again!"'
  - '"No... that''s everything I have. I''m not much of one for secrets and intrigues."'
  - "Camille looks utterly shocked when you press the money into her hands. \"Madame
    I can't possibly take this, it\x19s too much, it\x19s too...\" she trails off
    as she evaluates your expression, and composes herself a moment later."
  - You're starting to wonder if this investigation will ever start answering more
    questions than it asks.
  - Camille looks down at the money in her hand, then back at you, and sighs. "When
    you first came here, I didn't tell you the whole truth of Monsieur Armand's disappearance."
  - '"I should probably start making you lunch, hopefully this news will be better
    on a full stomach. Madame, I''ll have to ask you to leave the kitchen, while I
    work."'
  - "\"Ex-explain what?\" Camille asks, glancing between you and the bag of coins
    in your hands. \"Was that Monsieur Armand\x19s? Why would he leave money in the
    house?\""
  - '"I don''t think I''m very good at them."'
