  - Back home, you finally pull the note and key out from under your stays. Unfamiliar
    handwriting written in rich, emerald ink.
  - "\u2018Dear Armand,\n\nI will always appreciate your commitment to our cause,
    and I know France will be better for it. However, our chance of being caught grows
    with every passing day. I will not waste ink painting terrible pictures of the
    consequences, as you are already familiar with them.\u2019"
  - "\u2018If fortune turns against us, then I want you to flee Paris entirely. I
    know you\u2019ve objected to the idea before, but it\u2019s the only way for you
    to stay safe. To aid in this, I\u2019ve secreted a package under the loose floorboards
    beneath your stove. This key will open it.\u2019\n\nYou look at the key. It\u2019s
    still here, so Armand never received the note."
  - "\u2018Your partner in conspiracy,\n\nMarie-Jeanne\u2019"
  - "You turn over the letter and find no additional writing, no additional context
    or explanation. \n\nWho is Marie-Jeanne? How long has Armand known her for? Is
    she one of the people he\u2019d been writing back home?"
  - "Heading downstairs, you walk into the kitchen. It\u2019s clean but cramped, and
    Camille keeps it well stocked with fresh produce. You find the stove, made of
    dark iron and standing on a set of clawed feet. \n\nAlone, on your hands and knees,
    you feel around until you find a set of loose floorboards."
  - 'You pull up the floorboards and fish around in the dark until you find a small
    wooden box, held shut by a padlock. You open it with the key you found behind
    the painting. '
  - Inside the box you find a magnetic compass, a map of Paris with notes concerning
    when the guards change at every one of the city gates, and a leather bag heavy
    with coins.
  - "You look inside the bag\u2026 that\u2019s a lot of coins.\n\n(You have gained
    100 Livres!)"
  - You look up from your sudden windfall to see Camille standing in the doorway to
    the kitchen. Her eyes are darting between you and the box in confusion.
  - "\u201CI was just about to start making lunch\u2026\u201D Camille says, pointing
    awkwardly at the stove."
  - "\u201CKnow about what?\u201D Camille asks, glancing between you and the bag of
    coins in your hands. \u201CWas that Monsieur Armand\u2019s? Why would he leave
    money in the house?\u201D\n\nShe seems to be even more confused by all of this
    than you are."
  - "Camille looks utterly shocked when you press the money into her hands. \u201CMadame
    I can\u2019t possibly take this, it\u2019s too much, it\u2019s too\u2026\u201D
    she trails off as she evaluates your expression, and composes herself a moment
    later.\n\n(You have given away 25 Livres!)"
  - "\u201CMadame, what\u2019s going on?\u201D"
  - "\u201CI never asked anyone\u2019s names, madame.\u201D Camille admits, looking
    downcast. \u201CSo many of Monsieur Armand\u2019s guests valued their privacy,
    that I wanted to give them a polite amount space.\u201D"
  - "\u201CUnderstood madame!\u201D Camille replies cheerily. \u201CArmand required
    his privacy as well, it\u2019s no wonder the two of you were engaged.\u201D "
  - "\u201CMadame, what would you like me to do?\u201D"
  - "\u201CHowever...\u201D Camille straightens up, tapping her finger on her chin.
    \u201CThere was a woman who came by more frequently than the other guests. She
    had brown hair, and a scar on her chin.\nI remember her because she always wore
    a silver necklace, with the prettiest emerald in the center of it. "
  - You look down at the green ink used the write the note to Armand. A connection?
  - "\u201CThat\u2019s all I can remember madame. Now\u2026 if I may ask, can I have
    the kitchen to myself? I\u2019d like to start making your lunch.\u201D"
  - "After a brief pause, Camille ventures \u201CMadame, if I may ask, can I have
    the kitchen to myself? I\u2019d like to start making your lunch.\u201D"
