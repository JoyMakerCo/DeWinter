  - Your rendezvous complete, you decide to head home. Alexandre insists on walking
    you there, saying that he'd never forgive himself if he let some misfortune befall
    you.
  - Silently, he takes your hand.
  - The conversation dies down somewhat when he takes hold of you, but that doesn't
    matter. The warmth of his body says enough.
  - '"You''ve been in Paris for quite some time. Do you miss your family at all?"'
  - '"My word, that must be very hard for you." He says with a shake of his head.'
  - He smiles at your reply. "I can understand that. If we are a seed then family
    is the soil in which we grow. However, if we stay too close, we might find ourselves
    wilting in their shade."
  - '"There''s no need to apologize, at all. Blood is all well and good, but it doesn''t
    have to be the most important thing. Never be ashamed for wanting to make something
    of your own."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alexandre)
  - (You have gained some favor with Alexandre)
  - '"As for myself, I''m not sure if I really miss my family, such as it was..."'
  - '"You''ve had every reason to leave Paris, yet you''re still here. Why?"'
  - He nods along. "A good reason. History is being made every day, but here feels
    like the center of it all. You can feel the tension in the air. You can feel the
    passion burning in people's hearts."
  - '"I suppose that''s true." He admits.'
  - '"I feel much the same way." He replies, squeezing your hand gently.'
  - (You've gained some favor with Alexandre)
  - '"Though I hope you manage to find a more worthwhile reason to stay."'
  - (You've gained a little favor with Alexandre)
  - 'You continue to walk together, sticking near the buildings to avoid getting struck
    by any reckless carriages that might come barrelling down the street. Coachmen
    these days are paid for speed, not safety. '
  - The door of a house suddenly bursts open in front of you. A grimy man steps out.
  - Without a word, this man shoves you out of the way and silently starts marching
    down the street.
  - His face controted with anger, Alexandre yells at the man walking away from you."You!
    Monsieur! Halt, right now!"
  - The dragoon marches over to this man and looms over him, but not with the force
    of a soldier preparing for yet another fight. There's something else about Alexandre's
    demeanor. He is incensed, haughty, and imperious.
  - '"Have you taken leave of your senses, you loathsome imbecile? Do you think it
    is acceptable for a man to act this way? You will apologize to her, immediately!"'
  - While taken aback at first, the grimy man who treated you so rudely, sneers and
    replies "I shall do no such thing!"
  - '"I am-" Alexandre begins, but halts suddenly. He steps backwards, less sure of
    himself.'
  - '"I am... I am..."'
  - '"I am... nobody..."'
  - 'At this, Alexandre straightens up again, this time placing his hand on the pommel
    of his sabre. '
  - '"I owe nothing to you, madame." He sneers. "If you dislike my behavior so much,
    then don''t walk near my house!"'
  - '"... just the son of a slave..."'
  - At this, Alexandre straightens up again, this time placing his hand on the pommel
    of his sabre. "Monsieur, are you sure that's what you want to say to her?"
  - '"Madame is correct. I am one of the Queen''s Royal Dragoons, and those who insult
    me insult Her Majesty herself."'
  - At this, the boorish man feels less sure of himself. He grumbles a half-hearted
    apology to the both of you and scurries away, taking great care to avoid eye contact
    with either of you.
  - Alexandre tensely watches the man until he's completely out of sight. The dragoon
    is shaking a little.
  - He turns to you with a wide grin, as if nothing had happened at all. "Sorry about
    that. I'm normally much better about this sort of thing."
  - He looks uncertain. "That's good."
  - He relaxes, letting tension release from his shoulders. "That's to be expected,
    I imagine. I appreciate your candor."
  - '"... Dumas isn''t my real surname. It was my mother''s."'
  - '"Do you wish to disrespect your Queen, God preserve her, or do you wish to be
    as polite as decorum requires?"'
  - Alexandre looks to you, and gives a confident, thankful nod.
  - (You have gained some favor with Alexandre)
  - Alexandre looks to you, and gives a confident nod.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alexandre)
  - The grimy man stares at both of you expectantly, until he finally tires of your
    silence, and turns to leave.
  - He marches off into the night, presumably to be terrible to someone else.
  - '"Are you alright?"'
  - '"I''m... I''m fine as well."'
  - '"Still, you make fine company, even when we''re beset by the most boorish louts
    in Paris!"'
  - '"My father forbade me from enlisting under the family name. He felt I would be
    dragging it through the mud..."'
  - His next words are a whisper, one only you can hear.
  - '"Who the devil are you, to ask this of me?"'
  - The two of you walk and talk, and try to settle yourselves after what transpired.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alexandre)
  - '"I wanted to make something of myself, and it only brought him shame."'
  - '"Thank you for asking, Yvette. As you can imagine, I rarely have occasion to
    discuss these sorts of things."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Alexandre)
  - 'You both do a decent job it, and manage to almost forget that boorish man''s
    attempts to spoil your evening. '
  - Before you know it, you arrive at your humble home. Camille doesn't come out to
    greet you, but given the late hour, that's unsurpring.
  - '"<i>Bonne nuit</i>, Yvette." Alexandre says with bow. "Shall I see you again
    soon?"'
  - Inside, you gently step over Camille, who happens to be sleeping in the hallway.
    Heading upstairs to undress and to chronicle the evening's events in your journal,
    you wonder when you'll next learn more of this mysterious soldier.
  - Inside, you carefully step over Camille, who fell asleep in the hallway. You creep
    upstairs to undress and chronicle the evening's events in your journal. Unfortunately,
    you can't help but replay the evening's events in your head, and wonder what could
    possibly come next after that.

  - '"Yes, and no. I love them, but I can''t be who I really am when I''m around them."'
