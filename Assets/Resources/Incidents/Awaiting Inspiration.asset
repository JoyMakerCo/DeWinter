        than for the sound of a few pigeons feasting upon some grain that's been carelessly
        spilled in the road.

  _nodeText:
  - While exploring the streets of Paris, you find yourself on a calmer street than
    most. The cacophony of the city fades away, and things are quiet, other than for
    the sound of a few pigeons feasting upon some grain that's been carelessly spilled
    in the road.
  - Just as you are about to turn around to find something more stimulating, you spot
    a familiar face.
  - You pause to watch them, and wonder what it must be like to be content with something
    as simple as a handful of seeds. Is it a better life?
  - Then again, you've never seen a pigeon that still had all of its toes, so it can't
    be all that nice.
  - '"Oh, Yvette! What are you doing here?"'
  - '"..."'
  - '"Fancy that, I''m doing the exact same thing"'
  - She gestures to her bag. A few sketchbooks, brushes, and other art supplies are
    poking out of the top.
  - '"You''re lucky that it''s cute when you''re the one saying it."'
  - '"Do you have any suggestions? I need to practice."'
  - '"<i>Magnifique</i>!" She says, clapping her hands together. "Let''s go!"'
  - '"Hmm, that could work..." she mumbles, more to herself than anyone else. "Let''s
    go."'
  - She looks down at her bag, and shifts awkwardly. "I have plenty of willing subjects,
    and even commissions to complete, but none of it thrills me. None of it inspires
    me."
  - You stop in at a nearby tavern and take a seat. It's the middle of the day, but
    the crowd is closely packed.
  - '"I see what you mean, it is beautiful. Normally I focus on a single subject,
    but I haven''t drawn a crowd in a very long time." She sits at the fountain''s
    edge and starts to unpack her supplies.'
  - "After some time, \xC9lisabeth's feverish drawing begins to subside. What started
    as a storm of lines and sketching winds down to a few careful marks as she works
    to get everything just so. Eventually she stops altogether and lays the sketchbook
    on her lap."
  - You squeeze her hand back, savoring your closeness together.
  - She notices your change in expression. "He... doesn't know, and I don't think
    he needs to."
  - You stay and chat a little while longer, commenting on passing strangers, and
    trying to determine who would be more interesting to draw. Your mind often wanders
    back to what any of these people would say if they knew what the two of you were
    doing together, just paces from them.
  - She slowly draws her hand away from yours, making a point to tap her wedding ring
    against your own engagement ring.
  - Her voice is quiet, barely louder than a whisper. "I don't think I'm out of my
    slump just yet, but this is the closest I've felt in a long time."
  - She walks away briskly, leaving you in the square. After a few minutes, you decide
    to head home, still trying to make sense of what just happened.
  - "\xC9lisabeth stands up and gathers her things, hastily scribbling a note in her
    sketchbook. She tears out the paper and hands it to you. It's an address."
  - "As the sun starts to dip in the sky, \xC9lisabeth stands up and gathers her things.
    She stops to scribble a note in her sketchbook, then tears out the paper and hands
    it to you. It's an address. "
  - With that, she walks away, stopping only to glance back one last time before she
    leaves you in the square.
  - '"I can''t even remember the last time I was excited by my own work."'
  - '"What cheap romance did you pull that line from?"'
  - '"I''m out her to find something interesting to draw. Any ideas?"'
  - She squeezes your hand, slowly, tenderly.
  - "Not knowing what else to do, you look around the square to find some kind of
    distraction. Your wandering eyes catch a flash of sunlight glinting off of metal,
    and that's when you look down and notice it for the first time.\n\n\xC9lisabeth's
    wedding ring."
  - "However, none of these strangers notice. Without realizing it, they treat you
    and \xC9lisabeth like any other pair of people in the world, and it's freeing. "
  - "The two of you walk over to the fountain where you met Pierre, not that long
    ago. It's still as beautiful as you remembered it to be. The square has plenty
    of people in it, but it's not uncomfortably packed. \xC9lisabeth seems happy with
    it."
  - She starts drawing, faster than you've ever seen anyone draw before. There's no
    hesitation in her movements, instead she sketches with the confidence that can
    only come from decades of practice.
  - '"I''ve spent so much time worrying about people, but if I just draw their reflections
    in the water... all I have to do is focus on the shapes."'
  - '"Hmm, perhaps I can work with this." She says as she starts to unpack her supplies. '
  - After some time, Elisabeth's feverish drawing begins to subside. What started
    as a storm of lines and sketching winds down to a few careful marks as she works
    to get everything just so. Eventually she stops altogether and lays the sketchbook
    on her lap.
  - Her voice is quiet, barely louder than a whisper. "I don't think I'm out of my
    slump just yet, but I'm still happy you're here."
  - She squeezes your hand, slowly, tenderly.
  - You squeeze her hand back, savoring your closeness together.
  - Not knowing what else to do, you look around the square to find some kind of distraction.
    Your wandering eyes catch a flash of sunlight glinting off of metal, and that's
    when you look down and notice it for the first time.
  - Your index finger idly brushes along the top of her hand, and for the first time
    you notice something there, firm and unyielding.
  - She notices your change in expression. "He... doesn't know, and I don't think
    he needs to."
  - You stay and chat a little while longer, commenting on the strangers at the nearby
    tables, and trying to determine who would be more interesting to draw. Your mind
    often wanders back to what any of these people would say if they knew what the
    two of you were doing together, just paces from them.
  - She slowly draws her hand away from yours, making a point to tap her wedding ring
    against your own engagement ring.
  - "However, none of these strangers notice. Without realizing it, they treat you
    and \xC9lisabeth like any other pair of people in the world, and it's freeing. "
  - "As the crowd in the tavern starts to move on elsewhere, \xC9lisabeth stands up
    and gathers her things. She stops to scribble a note in her sketchbook, then tears
    out the paper and hands it to you. It's an address. "
  - 'With that, she walks away, stopping only to glance back one last time before
    she leaves you in the square. '
  - After a few minutes, you decide to leave the tavern and head home, your mind still
    swimming with emotion.
  - "\xC9lisabeth stands up and gathers her things, hastily scribbling a note in her
    sketchbook. She tears out the paper and hands it to you. It's an address. "
  - She walks away briskly, leaving you alone in the tavern.
  - After a few minutes, you decide to head home, still trying to make sense of what
    just happened.

  - '"Can you write me a letter, when you want to see me again?"'
  - Like you've been holding your breath your entire life, and are finally able to
    exhale.
  - '"Write me a letter if you change your mind."'
  - '"Is it really that bad? There are a million kinds of love, but we only have one

  - '"Can you write me a letter, when you want to see me again?"'
  - Like you've been holding your breath your entire life, and are finally able to
    exhale.
