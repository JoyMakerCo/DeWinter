        The priests in the cities are mostly second and third sons of noble familes,
        so they fervently support the Crown. On the other hand, the priests in the
        country have watched their parishes starve, and support the Revolution, or
        at least its ideals.'

  _nodeText:
  - After your rendezvous, Ludovico offers to walk you home. Soon, you find yourself
    chatting and laughing together, as you stroll home under the glow of the city
    lamps.
  - '"Ah yes! I almost forgot!" Ludovico suddenly yelps.'
  - He starts rummaging through his bag, looking for something. "I have a present
    for you."
  - 'Finally, he pulls a worn leather book out of his bag and hands it to you. The
    lamp light catches on the gilted lettering on the cover.


    ''Don Quixote'' reads the title.'
  - '"I originally started reading it in French to learn the language faster, but
    it''s always been a favorite of mine."'
  - '"It''s an adventure, it''s a comedy, and there''s also some delightfully biting
    social commentary. In short, it''s my favorite kind of story. I''ll always treasure
    Quixote''s sense of romance." '
  - '"Oh, is it not?" He asks with a certain amount of apprehension.'
  - '"Absolutely, I fell in love with his work years ago. I''ve especially enjoyed
    seeing how the meaning of the book has changed over time."'
  - '"When it was written, everyone saw it as a comedy about a fanciful madman. Then,
    years later, readers started to see it as a tragedy about a well meaning eccentric,
    ridiculed and ground down by an overly serious society."'
  - '"Will you at least give it a try? If not, I won''t pester you about this. The
    story itself isn''t important."'
  - '"But that''s not all," He says in a low voice.'
  - He gestures to his cassock. "Obviously, my situation didn't allow for me to follow
    his example, but such is life, and we do what we can."
  - '"Open it up."'
  - Equal parts curious and suspicious, you page through the book. At first you don't
    notice anything, but suddenly...
  - You start finding pages where the margins have been filled with densely packed
    notes. However, these notes aren't about the book or its characters. These are
    notes on the most prominent people in Paris.
  - This is a spy's goldmine.
  - '"Please Yvette, I''ve done good work, but let''s not take the Lord''s name in
    vain."'
  - '"Oh, I didn''t even think about that."'
  - '"Why? Because I trust you, Yvette. Because I know you''re ambitious and I want
    to help."'
  - '"I''ve already committed all of my notes to memory, so I felt it would be better
    in your hands than my own."'
  - '"I''ve had all the protections of being a priest, for so long that I forgot that
    others aren''t as lucky as I am."'
  - '"Still, I''m so glad that you like it." He glances around to make sure that you''re
    both alone. "Let me show you a few interesting things."'
  - Now that you're seeing the level of information at your finger tips, you're getting
    excited. This is a valuable book. Valuable indeed.
  - '"What? I know I''m not the best priest, but I have to at least try sometimes."'
  - He takes the book back from you. "I'll destroy this, as soon as I get home."
  - '"I''m so sorry. Have I upset you?"'
  - '"That''s good. I was worried that I''d done something terrible."'
  - '"My apologies, Yvette. I''ll try to be more thoughtful next time..."'
  - The two of you walk in silence for a while. You try to pretend it isn't an awkward
    silence, but the attempt is only partly succesful.
  - '"Over the last few months, I''ve written many letters back to Rome, and lately
    I''ve found myself in a difficult spot."'
  - '"Here, in France, the Church''s values have become extremely divided. The priests
    in the cities are mostly second and third sons of noble familes, so they fervently
    support the Crown. On the other hand, the priests in the country have watched
    their parishes starve, and support the Revolution, or at least its ideals.'
  - '"My superiors in Rome are asking me for a direction recommendation. Who should
    I tell them to support?"'
  - '"Over the last few months, I''ve written many letters back to Rome, and lately
    I''ve found myself in a difficult spot."'
  - '"Here, in France, the Church''s values have become extremely divided. The priests

    their parishes starve, and support the Revolution, or at least its ideals.'
  - '"My superiors in Rome are asking me for a direction recommendation. Who should
    I tell them to support?"'
  - '"Right now, I feel like the Crown might be the best choice."'
  - '"I simply don''t know who to choose."'
  - '"Right now, I think the Revolution might actually be the right choice."'
  - '"You''re right! The Crown has ruled with the Pope''s assent for centuries. There''s
    no reason for us to turn our backs on them now."'
  - '"You''re right! There are people starving in the streets. There has never been
    a more important time for us to help the poor and the downtrodden. I''ll recommend
    to my superiors that we throw our support behind the Revolutionaries."'
  - '"You''re right! There are people starving in the streets. There has never been
    a more important time for us to help the poor and the downtrodden. I''ll recommend
    to my superiors that we throw our support behind the Revolutionaries."'
  - '"The Crown? Are you sure? France is already in such a poor state. Perhaps this
    is the right time for a change."'
  - '"The Revolutionaries? Are you sure? They haven''t always expressed the best attitudes
    towards the Church."'
  - '"You''re right! The Crown has ruled with the Pope''s assent for centuries. There''s
    no reason for us to turn our backs on them now."'
  - He pauses, and rubs his chin thoughtfully. "Yet, the Lord has always instructed
    us to 'turn the other cheek'. Perhaps, if we show our willingness to work with
    them, the Revolutionaries will understand the good the Church brings with it."
  - '"No, I just don''t think I can recommend that. I can''t put our churches and
    convents in danger by supporting a movement that already wishes us ill."'
  - '"... and yet, I think you''re right! The Crown has ruled with the Pope''s assent
    for centuries. There''s no reason for us to turn our backs on them now."'
  - '"No, I just don''t think I can recommend that. We can''t support the Crown when
    the common people are starving in the streets. It''s not right."'
  - '"Thank you, Yvette. I wasn''t thinking clearly, and you''re the most savvy person
    I know. This has helped a lot."'
  - The two of you chat a while longer, the conversation quickly straying from politics,
    and back to more palatable subjects. A churchbell chimes in the distance, announcing
    that it's nearly midnight.
  - Thankfully, you're only a few blocks from your home, so it's not quite the greatest
    misfortune to ever befall you.
  - You walk home, clutching the book to your chest, and idly stroking its spine with
    your thumb.
  - "You start walking home, but something feels off. There are few people out in
    the street, and some of them seem pensive. Your spymaster, Th\xE9r\xE8se, told
    you to watch out for these signs."
  - Clutching the book tightly and steeling yourself, you spin around, ready to confront
    the person following you.
  - Yet, something feels off. There are few people out in the street, and some of
    them seem pensive, but you don't know why. You hear footsteps picking up behind
    you.
  - Without a word, you break into a run and dart down an alleyway. You can hear the
    footsteps pick up behind you, but as you switch directions and run through a few
    crowds of people, you hear those following footsteps fade into the distance.
  - 'Heart pounding, you manage to reach your home without any further incident, and
    Camille is there, waiting for you.


    "<i>Bonsoir</i> Madame!" She announces with her usual cheeriness. '
  - '"How was your night with Father Sidotti?"'
  - '"Of course madame!" Camille replies with a little too much enthusiasm as she
    brandishes a bronze firepoker. "I always keep this near me when I wait for you,
    just in case!"'
  - 'Suddenly, you find yourself face to face with a man that simply radiates malice.
    He holds an empty hand out towards you, but you can tell that he''s clutching
    a weapon in his hidden hand.


    Some of the people in the street are staring, fearfully watching this play out,
    but none of them look wiling to risk their lives by intervening.'
  - '"Madame, I''m here to make an offer. Give me that book, and I''ll spare your
    life."'
  - Reaching out with his free hand, he snatches the book from you and tucks it into
    his coat.
  - He sneers at you, and you can see something shift under his coat. "Do you really
    think I won't shoot you?"
  - Stepping out from the shadows, your bodyguard cracks his knuckles. "The lady would
    like to make a counter offer."
  - '"Walk away now, and I won''t cripple you in front of all these people."'
  - Startled by Hansel's sudden appearance, this assailant manages to stammer "L-listen
    here you-"
  - '"Don''t start." Hansel interrupts. "You''re holding a pistol under your coat,
    and you have a knife tucked into each boot. Trust me when I say that you will
    not have the chance to use any of them."'
  - '"It''s not a difficult decision." Your bodyguard continues. "Just walk away and
    tell your employer that you simply lost track of us. You can live to take another
    job."'
  - The assailant pauses to consider this. As he weighs his options, his face is a
    tumult of different emotions, none of them pleasant.
  - Without a word, the man angrily spits on the ground, and walks away.
  - You walk home, Hansel whistling a jolly tune beside you. Your heart is racing
    and you can bearly hear his song over the sound of your blood pumping in your
    ears, but you maintain your composure. You were prepared. You triumphed.
  - '"How was your night with Father Sidotti?"'
  - '"<i>Oui</i>, madame! Right away!" Camille says happily before disappearing into
    the cellar.'
  - Eventually, on wobbly feet, you head upstairs. There, you take notes, wonder about
    the night's events, and hopefully get some rest.
  - '"Oh, well that''s nice." Camille replies, taking your statement completely at
    face value.'
  - '"Oh... alright Madame." Camille replies, a mixture of hestitation and concern.'
  - '"It''s been a pleasure madame. I''ll be sure to give my employers your regards."
    He says with a toothy grin. You reply with a glare sharp enough to cut glass.'
  - With that, he jogs away, and takes a quick turn down an alleyway, disappearing
    from site. Some bystanders attempt to help, and ask how you're doing, but you
    ignore them. The chance for them to help you has long passed.
  - Sourly, you trudge home, imagining every vile punishment you would heap upon your
    assailant, should you ever get the chance to do so. Your own imagination manages
    to surprise you with its wicked inventiveness.
  - 'You manage to reach your home without any further incident, and Camille is there,
    waiting for you.


    "<i>Bonsoir</i> Madame!" She announces with her usual cheeriness. '
  - '"How was your night with Father Sidotti?"'
  - '"Oh, well that''s nice." Camille replies, taking your statement completely at
    face value.'
  - '"What? Are you ok? Do we need to contact the watch? Do we need to form a mob?"
    Camille asks, suddenly spewing a torrent of both her own concern and increasingly
    concerning solutions to your problem.'
  - You narrow your eyes at him, and clutch the book as tightly as you can.
  - You narrow your eyes at him, and clutch the book as tightly as you can. He glances
    around and notices all the people watching him. They're too scared to intervene,
    but they're still witnesses.
  - The gunshot is loud, almost impossibly so. You look down, and see blood running
    from your chest, before you lose your footing, and topple over in the street.
  - Slowly your vision grows darker, and darker, until nothing but blackness remains.
  - Slowly, carefully, he takes a step away from you. "You're a bold one madame, I'll
    give you that." He says, wagging his finger.
  - '"Just remember, everyone''s lucky until the day they aren''t." He makes a throat
    slitting motion before he hurries away and disappears into an alley.'
  - 'Heart pounding, you manage to reach your home without any further incident, and
    Camille is there, waiting for you.


    "<i>Bonsoir</i> Madame!" She announces with her usual cheeriness. '

  - The two of you chat a while longer, the conversation quickly straying from politics,
    and back to more palatable subjects. A churchbell chimes in the distance, announcing
    that it's nearly midnight.
  - '"Well, it appears that I''m going to be up late tonight." Ludovico sighs. "I
    told the abbot I would clean the relics."'
  - 'When you arrive home, Camille is already standing by the front door, waiting
    for you.


    "<i>Bonsoir</i> Madame! <i>Bonsoir</i> Father Sidotti!" She announces with her
    usual cheeriness. '
  - '"How was your night, madame?"'
  - '"Well, that''s a shame, madame. I hope you feel better in the morning."'
  - '"Well, I''m glad everything managed to work out, madame!" Camille replies.'
  - '"Fascinating, isn''t it? The words never changed, but the world around them did,
    so the meaning of the book changed with it."'
  - Preferences, rivalries, and alliances. They're all here.
  - '"..."'
  - Ludovico spends the next few minutes teaching you how to use the book. Apparently,
    there's some way of using the chapter titles to find different kinds of information
    quickly.
  - '"I''m so glad that you like it." He glances around to make sure that you''re
    both alone. "Let me show you a few interesting things."'

  - '"I''m sorry Yvette. I know it''s rude to ask for advice and disregard it, but
    I have to stick with my intuition."'
  - Picking up the pace, you hurry home so Ludovico can start towards his destination
    soon. For a moment, you get feeling like you're being watched, but it passes soon
    enough.
  - '"Ah, <i>Buonasera</i> Camille." Ludovico says, obviously distracted and anxious
    about the late hour. "And <i>buona notte</i> to you both, I must be off."'
  - With that, Ludovico turns and hurries off into the night, to attend to his priestly
    duties.
  - With that, you head upstairs to take notes, wonder about the night's events, and
    hopefully get some rest.
