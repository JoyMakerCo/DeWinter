  - After the rendezvous, Madame Gazel insists on giving you a ride back to your home.
    She's more energetic than usual.
  - '"Yvette, what would you do if you suddenly had a vast fortune?"'
  - She barely manages to cover up her laughter with one hand. "If nothing else Yvette,
    you are extremely consistent. If it helps, I would like to see you buried in that
    luxurious avalanche."
  - '"Really? You''d choose idleness?" She asks, her voice dripping disappointment.
    "Be careful. I''ve watched far too many people drift down that path. Even the
    greatest fortune slips away remarkably quickly if you don''t put it to real use."'
  - '"I couldn''t agree more. Once can only have so many things, but beyond that wealth
    is for shaping the world."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have gained some favor with Madame Gazel)
  - '"Of course, you already know that none of my questions are truly idle."'
  - '"These last few weeks, I''ve been doing my best on learning how to manage my
    sudden fortune. I finally feel like I actually know what I''m doing."'
  - '"When I was first tying to teach myself how to manage my affairs. I read Charles''
    journals, to see what he was thinking when he made all of his decisions." '
  - '"I''ve reached a point where I know that I''m safe to make my own decisions,
    and it doesn''t feel like Charles'' fortune anymore. I retire to my home, and
    it doesn''t feel like his house anymore. Everything truly feels mine."'
  - '"... and something about that leaves me feeling torn."'
  - '"Still, I appreciate your vote of confidence. I know that what I''m doing isn''t
    a short road, or one that really ends at all. But you''re right. It is progress,
    and it must be done."'
  - '"That''s exactly it." She says with a sad smile. "I''m afraid that I''ll forget
    him."'
  - '"Please don''t presume to tell me how I should and shouldn''t feel."'
  - '"And no, I didn''t put any money into wallpaper importing."'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have gained some favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - '"Of course, while I can actually manage the finances, what I don''t have is a
    purpose."'
  - '"Every day we say things like ''A day''s wage'' or ''It''s worth my time''. Money
    has always been the hours of human lives, wrapped into numbers. Something that
    precious should be used carefully, to build something better."'
  - "\"<i>Je suis d\xE9sol\xE9</i>, that was harsh of me,\" She sighs. \"What I mean
    is that I'm not naive. I know how laws govern property. I know who made the money
    in our marriage. As indulgent towards me as Charles was, everything was ultimately
    his decision. All the power was his.\""
  - She laughs and shakes her head. "In fact, the only reason I have any power at
    all is because he died."
  - '"The very nature of being wealthy means that my decisions affect a world much
    bigger than my own, even when I don''t intend to, but all I''ve determined is
    that I should be doing something with my fortune other than indulging myself."'
  - '"After all, I have you for that."'
  - '"Every day it feels like Paris is being pulled between such different visions
    for the future..."'
  - '"I know it''s ridiculous, but that doesn''t make me dread the possibility any
    less."'
  - '".. and I think the Crown is right. His Majesty is the only one with the experience
    to lead France."'
  - '"...and I simply don''t know who is right."'
  - '".. and I think the Revolutionaries are right. They''re the people, and so am
    I."'
  - '"You''re not wrong," she admits. "The Revolutionaries have spent so much time
    stoking hatred against the wealthy nobility that I''m not sure they''d remember
    what seperates the two of us."'
  - (The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Crown by quite a lot)
  - '"Well, I certainly can''t disagree with that." She says with a smile.'
  - '"I know you''re just appealing to my self interest, but you''re still right.
    I''m sick of being looked down upon by people who just happened to be born into
    the right family. People who demand that I fill France''s treasury, then sneer
    when I ask for a voice in how it''s spent."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - She smiles, satisfied. "This is the kind of savvy I appreciate in you."
  - (The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Revolution by quite a lot)
  - '"I''d also like to thank you for your patience."'
  - '"I imagine that most of your past romantic daliances didn''t involve someone
    bringing up their departed spouse so much."'
  - '"At least, for your sake, I hope not."'
  - '"I''m glad to hear that." She says, visibly relaxing.'
  - '"I appreciate you being honest with me," she says, patting the back of your hand.'
  - '"He was vivacious, kind, and indulgent. Life just burned inside him like furnace.
    Always looking for some new hill to conquer. Of course, it drove him mad to sit
    still, which sometimes led to him driving me mad, but that was alright."'
  - She blinks a few times, taken aback by your sudden zeal. "I must admit I didn't
    take you to be such an ardent revolutionary. Still, you are right. I'll see what
    I can do to make sure my spare funds support suitably revolutionary causes."
  - '"I''m glad you agree. I''ll see what I can do to make sure my spare funds support
    suitably Revolutionary causes."'
  - The next few moments are quiet, as she sits, deep in thought.
  - '"You''re right. As noble as the Revolution''s intentions are, they''re simply
    too dangerous. I need to devote my spare funds to support suitably monarchist
    causes."'
  - '"Absolutely not! What kind of person would I be if I ignored the plight of starving
    people because of some distant fear?"'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - The two of you sit in awkard silence for a while, shifting uncomfortably in your
    chairs.
  - (The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Crown by quite a lot)
  - (The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Revolution by quite a lot)
  - '(The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Revolution by quite a lot)

    (You have lost a little credibility)'

  - (The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Crown by quite a lot)
  - The next few moments are quiet, as she sits, deep in thought.
  - '"You''re right. The idle nobility will never treat us as anything more than a
    treasury to be raided. At least the Revolutionaries wish to see us as equals.
    I will devote my spare funds to supporting suitably Revolutionary causes."'
  - '"Yes, the Bourgeoisie bears the majority of the tax burden, but at least the
    Crown wants to protect us. The Revolutionaries will turn on us the moment it''s
    convenient.'
  - (The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Revolution by quite a lot)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - (You have gained some favor with Madame Gazel)
  - You lurch forward in your seat as the carriage comes to a halt. Pulling aside
    the dark curtains, you see that you've arrived at your home.
  - "Ren\xE9 opens the door, and helps you down, out of the carriage. "
  - You bend down low, and kiss the back of her hand.
  - She waves back but seems disappointed. She gives a silent signal to Rene, who
    remounts his coachman's box, cracks his whip, and soon her carriage disappears
    into the night.
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - That hand wraps around your chin and pulls your head upwards, and you find yourself
    with Madame Gazel staring down at you.
  - '"Good girl." She murmurs, low.'
  - 'She preses her lips against yours, gently seizing the back of your head with
    her free hand. Her touch is gentle, but firm. '
  - (You have gained a lot of favor with Madame Gazel)
  - Turning away, you see that Camille is waiting for your on the doorstep.
  - She lets go of the back of your head, and resumes gently holding you by the chin.
    "You may go for now. I will avail myself of you again, soon enough."
  - Letting go, she gives a silent signal to Rene, who remounts his coachman's box,
    cracks his whip, and soon her carriage disappears into the night.
  - '"Did you enjoy yourself, madame?"'
  - Camille lets you inside and you head upstairs to your bedroom. Passionate thoughts
    drift through your head as you write down the evening's events in your journal.
  - Camille lets you inside and you head upstairs to your bedroom. Discomforting thoughts
    drift through your head as you write down the evening's events in your journal.
  - '"D-Did you enjoy yourself, madame?" She stammers.'
  - '"O-oui Madame." She replies, and lets you inside.'
  - '"Don''t worry madame! I imagine you won''t have to endure such things for long!"
    She replies with an unusual amount of enthusiasm.'
  - '"What? N-No, of course not, madame!"'
  - It's then that you turn around and realize that Camille has been standing there
    the entire time. Standing stock still, she holds the door open for you.
  - You head upstairs to your bedroom, and passionate thoughts drift through your
    head as you write down the evening's events in your journal.
  - Camille lets you inside and you head upstairs to your bedroom. Discomforting thoughts
    drift through your head as you write down the evening's events in your journal.
  - '"I''m simply not sure if a woman of your station should... let themselves be
    handled like that." She says, failing to meet your gaze for the entire sentence.'
  - That answer feels suspiciously incomplete, but you'll let it pass. For now.
  - Camille lets you inside and you head upstairs to your bedroom. Curious thoughts
    drift through your head as you write down the evening's events in your journal.
  - '"Ugh!" She scoffs. "I curse whoever decided to make the things that are actually
    good for us so loathsome!"'
  - '"I always knew he was wound a little tight, but I had no idea how afraid he actually
    was. To him, the world was always two steps from complete disaster. He always
    had to be taking charge, and guiding things to a proper path."'
  - Her reverie turns to a whistful smile "I suppose that would explain while his
