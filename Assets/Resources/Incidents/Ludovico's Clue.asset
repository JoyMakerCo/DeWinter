  _nodeText:
  - "You leave the house earlier than usual that morning, uncertain of how long it\u2019ll
    take you to walk to the fountain that Ludovico mentioned in his letter to you."
  - "Given that you\u2019re still new to skullduggery, you\u2019ve decided to dress
    in darker clothes, and have stuck to comfortable walking shoes."
  - "Surprisingly enough, you manage to find the fountain without getting turned around.
    It seems like the perfect place for a meeting like this. There\u2019s just enough
    people wandering around that you won\u2019t draw attention, but also few enough
    that you\u2019ll be able to find somewhere secluded to talk."
  - "Looking around, you can\u2019t spot Ludovico anywhere, so you decide to take
    a seat at the edge of the fountain. It makes sense to be visible enough that he\u2019ll
    be able to find you without any flashy waving or signalling. "
  - "You get comfortable, smooth out your skirts and pause for a moment to reflect
    on the decisions that led you to a point in your life where you\u2019re having
    secret rendezvous with priests to learn more about your hated enemies. If anything,
    they must have been some good decisions."
  - "Some time later, after you\u2019ve waved away a particularly enthusiastic tea
    salesman for the third time, a familiar face emerges from behind the shadows of
    a tree.\n\n\u201C<i>Bonjour</i> madame\u201D he nods pleasantly. \u201CYou seem
    troubled.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIs there anything this humble priest can help you with?\u201D"
  - "\u201CThat is an excellent idea madame. Please lead the way.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThat\u2026\u201D"
  - "You find a quiet corner in the square to speak with Ludovico. It\u2019s secluded
    and shady. \n\nLudovico takes a deep breath before he begins."
  - "\u201CI know I\u2019ve already said this before, but I still want to tell you
    that I\u2019m sorry for everything that happened to you. From what I know, Marcelle\u2019s
    always had a penchant for being vindictive. This, combined with her wealth and
    position, makes her a force to be reckoned with.\u201D"
  - "\u201C... is a very good point,\u201D he admits with a defeated sigh. You can
    tell that he was quite enjoying this air of intrigue, but you\u2019d rather have
    some quick results. Ludovico sits down next to you and composes himself."
  - "\u201CStrangely enough, the moment I actually started looking into Marcelle\u2019s
    wealth and position, something didn\u2019t feel right. She claims that her storied
    family fortune comes from a series of wise investments, so I started paying visits
    and offering blessings to some of her family\u2019s known business partners. In
    that whole time, I couldn\u2019t find evidence that any of her family\u2019s investments
    were older than thirty years or so.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThirty years is a long time for most people, yes, but compared to most
    aristocratic families, that\u2019s barely the blink of an eye. From the mindset
    of the clergy, it\u2019s even less. There are churches in France that are over
    1,000 years old. Why would her family pretend their fortune is older than it really
    is?\u201D"
  - "\u201CIt feels like Marcelle is hiding something, and it has to do with her money.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThink nothing of it madame, I\u2019m just trying to do the right thing.\u201D"
  - "Ludovico leans in close and whispers in your ear, his voice barely audible. \u201CMadame,
    Rome chose me as their eyes and ears in France. You didn\u2019t think that they\u2019d
    sent someone who\u2019s never gotten their hands dirty, did you?\u201D"
  - "You\u2019re not sure if Ludovico helping you exact your revenge could really
    be classified as \u2018the right thing\u2019, but you\u2019re not going to complain."
  - "\u201CWhile I must go, remember that all of this is speculation. If you want
    to use any of this information against Marcelle, you\u2019ll need indisputable
    proof of whatever lies or wrongdoing she\u2019s engaged in, or it\u2019ll simply
    be your word against hers. Still, I will pray for your success.\u201D"
  - "\u201C...\u201D"
  - "\u201CHaha! Sorry, I\u2019ve always wanted to say something like that.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHonestly, it\u2019s been a nice change of pace. Normally I just spend a
    lot of time listening to bishops and writing letters back to the Vatican. This
    has me out and about, enjoying Paris, and getting a feel for its people.\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Ciao</i>, madame.\u201D Ludovico says before leaving."
  - "You stop to think about this new information. Marcelle is a wealthy aristocrat,
    but her fortune appears to be younger than she claims. It seems like this knowledge
    could be useful, but you\u2019ll have to dig deeper first."
  - (You have lost a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - (Researching Marcelle is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - With that, you start to head home, already planning your next move against your
    sworn enemy.
