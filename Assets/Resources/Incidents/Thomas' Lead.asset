  _nodeText:
  - "You leave the house earlier than usual that morning, uncertain of how long it\u2019ll
    take you to walk to the fountain that Thomas mentioned in his letter to you.\r"
  - "Given that you\u2019re still new to skullduggery, you decided to dress in darker
    clothes, and stuck to comfortable walking shoes."
  - "Surprisingly enough, you manage to find the fountain without getting turned around.
    It seems like the perfect place for a meeting like this. There\u2019s just enough
    people wandering around that you won\u2019t draw attention, but also few enough
    that you\u2019ll be able to find somewhere secluded to talk.\r"
  - "Looking around, you can\u2019t spot Thomas anywhere, so you decide to take a
    seat at the edge of the fountain. It makes sense to be visible enough that he\u2019ll
    be able to find you without any flashy waving or signalling. "
  - "You get comfortable, smooth out your skirts and pause for a moment to reflect
    on the decisions that led you to a point in your life where you\u2019re having
    secret rendezvous with a member of the Queen\u2019s Dragoons to learn more about
    your hated enemies. If anything, they must have been good decisions.\r"
  - "Not long after you\u2019ve settled in, Thomas appears from around a corner and
    strides up to you. The uniform draws some attention, but people seem to make an
    effort of getting out of his way, so it must be useful for something. \r\n\r\n\u201C<i>Bonjour</i>
    madame!\u201D he calls out pleasantly. \u201CMy sincerest apologies for being
    late.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CShould we stay here, or discuss this somewhere in private?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Magnifique</i>! There\u2019s a tavern nearby that\u2019s always empty
    in the middle of the day. We\u2019ll discuss things further there.\u201D"
  - '"..."'
  - "Thomas leads you to the tavern and you take a seat with him. The barmaid seems
    to recognize him, and brings over some wine and two glasses.\r\n\r\n\u201CDon\u2019t
    worry, I\u2019ll cover the cost of the wine,\u201D he assures you with a wave.\r"
  - "\u201CI take it that you\u2019ve read my letter, so you know how much I regret
    what happened to you that night. From what I know, Maximin\u2019s always been
    a bit of a prick, but I never would have suspected him to stoop so low.\u201D\r"
  - "He throws back his head and laughs. \u201CI don\u2019t know if you noticed this
    madame, but I have a tendency to stick out, even when I\u2019m not in uniform.\u201D
    He stops to glance pointedly at the passers-by staring at him, who struggle to
    avert their gaze in time.\r"
  - "\u201CAt least when I\u2019m wearing the Queen\u2019s colors, people get out
    of my way.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHowever, if you\u2019d prefer discretion, there\u2019s a tavern nearby,
    which is always empty in the middle of the day. We can step inside there to talk.\u201D"
  - "\u201CSo, seeing a chance to correct a great injustice, I reached out to some
    friends around the city in order to gather intelligence. Does Maximin actually
    lead by example, or is all of his revolutionary talk just that... talk?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CWhile I couldn\u2019t find a smoking gun, I also couldn\u2019t help but
    notice that Maximin\u2019s household goes through servants quite quickly.\u201D
    He reaches into his coat pocket and hands you a list of names, presumably of servants
    that used to work for Maximin. \u201CMost of them left of their own accord, usually
    citing things like long hours, skipped wages, and other issues. However, there\u2019s
    one servant whose leaving was a complete mystery.\u201D"
  - "\u201CA servant who leaves their master, but keeps their reasons a secret\u2026
    if Maximin has a weakness, then this is it.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CUnfortunately madame, I have no next step.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWe\u2019ve known each other for less than a few days? You really think
    I\u2019m a man of honor?\u201D "
  - "\u201CWhile my position grants me it\u2019s fair share of privileges, it also
    means I can\u2019t go much further than providing you with information. If I was
    caught actually helping you exact your revenge, it would reflect very poorly on
    the royal family.\u201D"
  - "\u201CNo matter how justified that vengeance might be.\u201D"
  - "\u201CUnfortunately,\u201D Thomas pushes out his chair and stands. \u201CI\u2019m
    needed back at the barracks. Before I go, I must warn you that this mystery servant
    has gone to great pains to conceal their identity\u2026\u201D"
  - "\u201C...\u201D"
  - "\u201CWell, you\u2019re right! You\u2019re quite the keen judge of character,
    madame.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHowever, I don\u2019t see anything dishonorable about what I\u2019m doing.
    Maximin has slandered your good name, and that of your fiance. Given his position,
    you have no means of recourse against him. It\u2019s only right that I help you
    defend your character.\u201D"
  - "\u201CBesides, I\u2019ve been in a\u2026 similar situation. Of course, back then,
    I never had anyone to help me. If I can make it so that nobody ever faces such
    misfortunes alone again, I will have changed the world for the better.\u201D "
  - "\u201CI couldn\u2019t find this servant\u2019s name, where they live, or even
    the position they held in Maximin\u2019s home.\u201D Thomas pauses to leave some
    coins on the table for the wine. \u201CWhile you don\u2019t seem the sort to give
    up easily, I wanted to make sure you understood the difficulty of the task ahead
    of you.\u201D"
  - "Thomas stands and gives you a theatrical bow. \r\n\r\n\u201C<i>Au revoir</i>,
    madame.\u201D With that, he turns and leaves."
  - "You stop to think about this new information. A mystery servant, who left Maximin\u2019s
    employment suddenly, and under murky circumstances. It seems fruitful, but you\u2019ll
    have to dig deeper first."
  - (You have lost a little credibility)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - (Researching Maximin is now available to visit in the Paris map)
  - With that, you start to head home, already planning your next move against your
    sworn enemy.
