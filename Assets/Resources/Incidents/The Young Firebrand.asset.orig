  - "You spot two guests who are talking to each other, but appear to be on the lookout
    for someone else. Every few moments their conversation breaks off so they can
    collectively glance around the room. Something about them feels tense.\r"
  - "\u201CIs he even attending tonight?"
  - "\u201CI have no idea, though we should be able to spot him quite easily. Keep
    on the lookout for a remarkably handsome young man with charisma, a hatred for
    authority and a penchant for extreme violence.\u201D The man replies, a little
    too loudly, while he pretends to sip from a glass of wine.\r"
  - "The woman stares are her friend incredulously \u201CHow, exactly, does one spot
    \u2018a penchant for extreme violence\u2019?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CWell, that\u2019s certainly a good start.\u201D The woman admits, and makes
    some room for you in conversation circle.\r\n\r\n\u201CAre you looking for Monsieur
    Saint-Just as well?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CLouis Antoine de Saint-Just\u201D the older man whispers to you as he steps
    to the side and lets you into the conversation circle. \u201COur host, Maximin,
    invited him from Bl\xE9rancourt. Maximin thinks the young man would make a fine
    revolutionary, but I have my doubts.\u201D\r"
  - "Before you can answer, her friend interrupts you \u201COf course she is. That
    maniac is the only person anyone here is talking about.\u201D"
  - "A wry smile creeps across the woman\u2019s face and she pats her friend reassuringly
    on the arm \u201CA maniac? Surely, you\u2019re just exaggerating.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019m not. I\u2019ll concede that Saint-Just\u2019s a charismatic boy,
    that much is true. However, don\u2019t forget that he led a student revolution
    at his own university. He tried to put the whole school to the torch! I\u2019m
    all one for building alliances, but I don\u2019t think Maximin should have invited
    him. The Third Estate doesn\u2019t need people like that.\u201D"
  - "The woman grimaces. \u201CI hadn\u2019t heard that part. What about you? Do you
    think it was right to invite Saint-Just?\u201D"
  - "Nodding along, the older nationalist replies. \"So, you saying that if we let
    Saint-Just to form his own movement, we'd give the first and second estates an
    easy choice. They must either negotiate with our peaceful reforms, or fight Saint-Just\x19's
    uprising.\x1D\r\""
  - "\u201CAh, I see\u2026 you are one of his ilk.\u201D The older man replies to
    you, taking a sip from his wine glass. \u201CAnother who can\u2019t imagine progress
    without violence. I\u2019m sure Saint-Just will love your fervor, give him my
    regards.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CQuite right!\u201D The man agrees with you. \u201CThe Estates General is
    soon, and we need to stay focused on what\u2019s important, and what we can all
    agree on. Taxing the nobility, engaging in land reform, and beginning a constitutional
    monarchy.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CDoubts? What have you heard? All I\u2019ve heard is that he\u2019s young,
    zealous, and handsome. A charismatic firebrand.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIt\u2019s that zealous part that I\u2019m worried about.\u201D The older
    man replies, furrowing his brow. \u201CI\u2019ve never met him, but I know a few
    men that have. Saint-Just is very open to the idea of violence in order to secure
    freedoms for the Third Estate, and is quite cold to those who don\u2019t agree.
    One isn\u2019t supposed to treat politics like a religion.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThere\u2019s something dark in that boy, and it worries me.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI hope you\u2019re happy.\u201D His friend hisses to you, surprisingly
    angry. \u201CThat kind of talk doesn\u2019t benefit anyone.\u201D\r"
  - She stalks away from you as well, leaving you with your thoughts. You take a few
    moments to collect yourself before rejoining the rest of the party.
  - "\u201CAgreed! To a new, harmonious France!\u201D His friend raises her wineglass
    and you toast together, and drink deep of the red wine you obtained from a servant
    earlier.\r"
  - After your toast, you spend a few more minutes with these guests, exchanging banter
    and political ruminations. Much of it is unfamiliar to you, but by the end of
    the conversation you find yourself able to keep up pretty easily.
  - "He doubtfully cocks his eyebrows, and you can feel your point start to slip away.
    \u201CThen, once we won, we'd just\u2026 convince the violent uprising to stop.\u201D\r"
  - "Mulling over your point, he nods affably, but his friend is the one to speak
    first. \u201CYou\u2019re saying that the more unflinching and dire Saint-Just
    becomes, the more reasonable we seem. Maybe we should encourage him.\u201D\r"
  - 'You spend a few more minutes with these guests, exchanging banter and political
    ruminations. Eventually, with an exchange of polite nods, you part ways with your
    erstwhile friends in order to explore the rest of the party. '
  - Well, it sounded a lot better in your head than it did out loud.
  - "\u201CYou believe we won\u2019t succeed without violent radicals like Saint-Just
    to make the Crown listen to us. Yet, we\u2019ll be able to convince our own violent
    extremists to stop, just with words? Both of those can\u2019t be true at the same
    time.\u201D The woman shakes her head.\r"
  - After a few awkward attempts to restart the conversation, the two of them walk
    away, leaving you with your thoughts. You take a few moments to collect yourself
    before rejoining the rest of the party.
  - "Eventually, with an exchange of polite nods, you part ways with your erstwhile
    friends in order to explore the rest of the party.\r"
  - "(You have gained a little credibility)\r\n(You have lost a little favor with
    Louis Antoine de Saint-Just)\r"
  - (You have gained a little peril)
  - "(You have gained a little favor with Louis Antoine de Saint-Just)\r"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with Louis Antoine de Saint-Just)\r"
  - "(You have lost some credibility)\r"
  - "He walks away from the conversation without even excusing himself.\r"
