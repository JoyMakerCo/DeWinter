  _nodeText:
  - "After waiting around for a few hours, you leave the Orphan\u2019s Feast, dragging
    your small mountain of luggage behind you. After all, the coach was only hired
    to take you to the tavern. Armand may not have been waiting for you like he said
    he would, but you memorized his address from all of the times you wrote it on
    your letters to him.\r"
  - "It\u2019s the middle of the night, but the street is still teeming with life.
    The light from the windows and the street lamps sparkle like the stars. You\u2019re
    tired and your feet hurt, but still, you can\u2019t help but smile.\r\n\r\nThis
    is it. This is Paris. No matter what happens, you\u2019re still here. \r"
  - "For a brief moment, you\u2019re not a country girl dragging luggage through the
    streets. You\u2019re the person you feel that you are, when you close your eyes,
    alone."
  - "You\u2019re overseeing a grand salon, surrounded by poets, musicians, scientists,
    philosophers, and artists. You are elegant, sophisticated, and respected.   "
  - "You\u2019re getting close to the address. Armand never described his living conditions
    much, but he\u2019s the son of a Baron and his family was always well to-do, especially
    compared to yours. You\u2019ve spent a lot of time in that carriage wondering
    about the home you\u2019d spend your new life in.\r"
  - "Still, you didn\u2019t expect this..."
  - "Calling the house \u2018rustic\u2019 would imply that you were out in the country,
    not in the center of a city. The neighborhood is nice enough, but you\u2019re
    worried that if you breathe too hard on the building, it\u2019ll fall over. A
    well kept woman in the attire of a maid opens the door and approaches you.\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Ah, bonsoir!</i> I assume you must be Madame Yvette! My name is Camille,
    Monsieur Armand told me to expect you.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI\u2026 I was hoping that he was with you.\u201D Camille replies hesitantly.
    \u201CI haven\u2019t seen him in days.\u201D"
  - "\u201CImpossible, Madame! I\u2019ve taken care of all the rats myself.\u201D
    Camille replies, emphasizing her point with a playful stomp of her foot. \r"
  - "Eyeing her worn shoes, you have a feeling the rats didn\u2019t go quietly."
  - "\u201CI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine Madame,\u201D Camille replies with a tone
    of voice that doesn\u2019t fill you with confidence. Glancing around, Camille
    seems to notice your mountain of luggage for the first time. \u201C<i>Mon Dieu,
    Madame!</i> Did you carry this all yourself? You must be exhausted!\u201D\r"
  - "At this, Camille takes a deep, nervous breath. \u201CI\u2019m afraid to tell
    you that you\u2019ll have to wait, Madame. It\u2019s been days since I\u2019ve
    seen Monsieur Armand. I was hoping that he was with you.\u201D "
  - "She\u2019s not wrong. You\u2019re not certain how you\u2019re still upright and
    awake right now. \r"
  - "You take your diary and leave the heavy lifting to Camille. The inside of the
    house isn\u2019t much better than the outside. Camille keeps the place tidy, but
    she can only do such much. Still, you don\u2019t care about that right now, you\u2019re
    just happy to have a roof over your head."
  - "You flop down on a nearby couch, open your diary, and start to write. You\u2019re
    tired, disappointed, and perhaps abandoned, but writing things down always helps
    you make sense of a situation."
  - "While you\u2019re still processing this latest disappointment, Camille seems
    to notice your mountain of luggage for the first time. \u201C<i>Mon Dieu, Madame!</i>
    Did you carry this all yourself? You must be exhausted!\u201D"
  - '"I''m sure he''s fine Madame," Camille replies with a tone of voice that doesn''t
    fill you with confidence. "I''m sorry to tell you this, but I haven''t seen Monsieur
    Armand in days. I was hoping he was with you."'
  - Glancing around, Camille seems to notice your mountain of luggage for the first
    time. "<i>Mon dieu Madame!</i> Did you carry this all yourself? You must be exhausted!"
  - "\x1CI\x19ve already made up your bed Madame, please go inside and let me take
    care of this.\x1D\r"
