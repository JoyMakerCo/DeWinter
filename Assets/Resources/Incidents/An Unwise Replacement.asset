  _nodeText:
  - The day has opened with staggering news. The King has just dismissed Monsieur
    Jaques Necker, who was both the Prime Minister, and the Controller-General of
    Finances.
  - Monsieur Necker's reputation as a friend of the people was so great that he was
    welcomed into office with a fireworks display. While it's understood that he was
    always a controversial figure, his competence has never been in question.
  - He argued for the abolition of serfdom, and once broke a policy stalemate by leaking
    the national budget to the press, in order to show the people how dire the county's
    situation really was.
  - "However, this public favor wasn't enough to save him. The King dismissed him
    from office, and the new Controller-General of Finances is Monsieur Joseph-Fran\xE7ois
    Foullon."
  - "Dismissing Necker was already guaranteed to be unpopular, and replacing him with
    a converative deeply loyal to the interests of the nobility would have been bad
    enough, but Monsieur Foullon isn't just disliked. \n\nHe is despised."
  - 'During the last famine, when asked of the plight of the common people, Monsieur
    Foullon replied "If those rascals have no bread, then let them eat hay!"


    The common people have not forgotten this.'
  - The great tension that hangs over the country continues to build. Even alone in
    your home, you can feel it in the air, heavy and thick, like the smoke from a
    burning building.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
