  _nodeText:
  - Yesterday, there was a hot air balloon launch on the lawn of the palace at Versailles.
    The public is absolutely fascinated by these new machines, though you remain unconvinced.
  - These balloons, invented by the Montgolfier brothers, were richly decorated with
    the King's heraldry. Apparently it was quite a sight.
  - In fact, the King himself decided at the last minute, to ride along and ascend
    in the first balloon. Witnesses have lovingly described the King as 'standing
    astride the heavens like a demigod of antiquity'. The Montgolfiers have been showered
    with praise for both their achievements towards the sciences, and to the prestige
    of the royal household.
  - The launch itself went extremely well, but apparently that was the problem. Those
    attending couldn't help but notice that despite all of the King's royal privileges,
    special seating, and resplendent symbols, all of the event's focus was on the
    balloons themselves. The King, who already struggles with asserting himself, put
    on a spectacle that he was not the center of.
  - '(The Crown has lost a little power)

    (The Bourgeoisie has gained some power)'
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - '(The Crown has gained some power)

    (The Bourgeoisie has moved a little closer to the Crown)'
  - Perhaps royal traditions shall be eclipsed by this swell of science and innovation.
