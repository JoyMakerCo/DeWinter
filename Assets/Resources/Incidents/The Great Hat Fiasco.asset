  - "The Estates General has led to some interesting quandaries. The King\u2019s made
    it clear that he plans to set a bold new direction for France, but has been unclear
    on what that actually means."
  - To that end, yesterday revealed one of the strangest of such pitfalls in known
    memory. This incident centers on who, exactly, is allowed to wear a hat.
  - At a preliminary meeting before the Estates General, the King took off his hat
    to salute the assembled members. In response, as per custom, all the assembled
    nobles and commoners removed their hats as a sign of respect. However, after this
    greeting, only the king and the nobles were supposed to put their hats back on,
    while the members of the Third Estate were supposed to remain without.

    (The Revolution has gained a little power)'
  - Whether it was an act of clear rebellion, or mere confusion in the face of ancient
    and arcane ceremony, many members of the Third Estate put their hats back on.
    This functionally signalled that they felt themselves the equals of the nobility,
    and the King.
  - And so, in Paris, life goes on.
  - For reasons that even you find unclear, this whole affair was deemed utterly scandalous.
    It's said that the Queen herself went pale with rage at this collapse of ceremony.

    and arcane ceremony, many members of the Third Estate put their hats back on.
    This functionally signalled that they felt themselves the equals of the nobility,
    and the King.
  - It's not just the Queen either. Many have already seen this incident as an harbinger
    of more disorder to come.
  - However, the King managed to diffuse this situation with a joke, congratulating
    the members of the Third Estate on their sudden, and miraculous promotion. He
    then turned everyone's attention to the business at hand. If this was a subtle
    challenge to the King's authority on the part of the Third Estate, then it fell
    flat.
