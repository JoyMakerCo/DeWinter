    - Text: At this, Camille takes a deep, nervous breath. "I'm afraid to tell you
        that you'll have to wait Madame. It's been days since I've seen Monsieur Armand.
        I was hoping that he was with you."

    - Text: You take your diary and leave the heavy lifting to Camille. The inside
        of the house isn't much better than the outside. Camille keeps the place tidy,
        but she can only do so much. Still, you don't care about that right now, you're
        just happy to have a roof over your head.

    - Text: You flop down on a nearby couch, open your diary, and start to write.
        You're tired, disappointed, and perhaps abandoned, but writing things down
        always helps you make sense of a situation.
