  - "You spend some time waiting in the long line outside. It appears that Marcelle
    has invited all of the great and the good of Paris. The ones that meet her particular
    standards, at least.\r\n\r\nYour heart starts to race when you think about all
    of the people in this line that may have witnessed your humiliation at that fateful
    party all those nights ago. \r"
  - "You inhale deeply through your nose in an effort to calm yourself, and realize
    that this mask still faintly smells like Armand. \r\n\r\nYou slowly regain your
    composure when you start to note a lack of second glances in your direction. It
    appears that this mask has really done the trick in terms of concealing your identity.\r"
  - "Inside, you see the same doorman as before, who seems to be enjoying the opportunity
    to boss around anyone trying to enter the party.\r"

  - "He looks over the invitation, making a great show of inspecting it for authenticity.
    After it passes muster, he places the paper inside his coat.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou
    may enter, Madame.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CAh, I didn\u2019t realize the good Father was bringing a date with him.
    You must be a very\u2026 pious woman to be so close to a man of the clergy.\u201D\r"
  - Your first instinct is to slap the smug grin off of his presumptive, leering face.

  - "However, for better or for worse, your reason wins out. You refrain from hitting
    him, and maintain your cover by chuckling dryly, as if he was actually funny.
    \r\n\r\nEven if his rude implications about you and Ludovico are correct, he could
    still be polite enough to keep his comments to himself.\r"
  - "After a brief pause, the dooman steps aside and allows you to pass.\r \u201CYou
    may enter, Madame.\u201D\r"

  - "The doorman grins and leans in a little closer before saying \u201CAh, the honorable
    Corporal must be very lucky to find a date who\u2019s so\u2026 fair.\u201D\r"
  - "You don\u2019t expect everyone to approve of your liaison with Thomas. However,
    you also don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect people to keep their
    insipid witticisms to themselves."
  - "It takes a moment before you realize what he\u2019s talking about. Once you do,
    it takes every fiber of your being to resist slapping him. "
  - "You may not actually be seeing Thomas romantically, but you\u2019re absolutely
    stunned how glibly this doorman is willing to say such cruel things about him. "
  - "\u201CInvitation, Madame?\u201D he asks expectantly."
  - "\u201CAh, I didn\u2019t realize Madame Gazel was bringing one of her friends
    with her.\u201D"
  - "You can\u2019t help but smile slightly at the way the doorman so innocently refers
    to you as Madam Gazel\u2019s \u2018friend\u2019.\r"
  - "He looks over the invitation, making a great show of inspecting it for authenticity.
    When he reads the name of the addressee, he looks you up and down for a moment.
    \r\n\r\n\u201CAh, Madame Gazel! I barely recognized you in these\u2026 uncharacteristically
    bright colors.\u201D\r"
  - "He steps aside and bows deeply to you.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou may enter, Madame.\u201D\r"
