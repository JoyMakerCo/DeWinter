  - "You nearly mistake the woman standing in front of you for some kind of walking
    confection. A pampered dog lounges in her arms. \u201CI don\u2019t believe we
    had the chance to properly introduce ourselves. I am Viscountess Marcelle de Foix.\u201D "
  - "Her voice raises in volume imperceptibly, but it\u2019s enough to draw the attention
    of the large crowd in the room. \u201CEveryone, this is Yvette, Armand\u2019s
    fiancee!\u201D"
  - "A murmur of interest washes through the crowd, and you can feel their eyes focus
    on you.\r"
  - "\u201CWhere is Armand, by the way?\u201D"
  - "\u201CThat is so sweet of him!\u201D Marcelle trills and her dog yips happily.
    \u201CYou\u2019ve barely arrived from the country and he still wants you to meet
    all the people he\u2019s been so fortunate to associate with. It\u2019s very kind
    of you to represent him like this, and I\u2019m sure that he\u2019ll be well soon.\u201D\r"
  - "Marcelle stares at you, concerned and shocked. \u201CYou don\u2019t know where
    he is, and yet you still came to this little event of mine?\u201D She gestures
    a free hand at the most splendid party you\u2019ve ever seen in your life. \u201CThat
    is so kind of you, of course I\u2019ll help!\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI mean, I was hoping he\u2019d show his face here, but you\u2019ll do.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI guess it makes sense that you\u2019re here. Armand could never stop pestering
    his betters, so it feels rather appropriate that, even when sick, he\u2019d send
    his peasant fiance to do it for him.\u201D The crowd, which only seems to be growing,
    murmurs in agreement. \u201CIn fact, I almost thought I was rid of him once and
    for all\u2026\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYet here you are, with a fresh set of nuisances. Does this ever end?\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhy? While those craven nationalists in their dingy salons like to hide
    behind their pamphlets and newsletters, people of quality must be brave enough
    to denounce our enemies in person.\u201D "
  - "Marcelle pauses to pet her dog. \u201CI don\u2019t know where he is. In fact,
    it\u2019s a shame that Armand\u2019s already scurried off somewhere. I was really
    hoping to tell him this to his face, but then again, he always was so good at
    disappointing people. You\u2019ll have to do.\u201D\r"
  - "For a moment, the crowd hushes. You seem to have struck a nerve. Even the dog
    looks a little undone. \u201CI suppose that when cornered, even a rat will think
    it\u2019s a lion,\u201D Marcelle whispers, her voice like ice.\r"
  - "\u201CAfter all, you\u2019ve already helped me!\u201D"
  - "\u201CArmand, that ambitious little rat, was always reaching above his station.
    Always asking for people to listen to ideaa that nobody should even dare entertain!
    His audacity truly knew no bounds.\u201D Her eyes are focused on you, but she\u2019s
    speaking to the crowd, who seem to whisper in agreement. Even the dog regards
    you with malice."
  - "\u201CNow, not only do I find out that he\u2019s a coward, who\u2019s fled his
    fiance, and the consequences of his gall\u2026\u201D"
  - "\u201Cbut now, I have this commoner, who doesn\u2019t know her place either!\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYour Armand is a conniving, traitorous, opportunist who sullies the good
    name of the entire nobility just by being alive. The only reason he even chose
    a common girl like you to be his wife, is because any lady of good breeding would
    see him for the weasel that he is.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CPlease pay attention, because I hate repeating myself. Your Armand is gone,
    off somewhere on another one of his foolish little political endeavors. However,
    if you should ever find him, tell him that he is an traitorous weasel, who should
    go back to whatever backwater he crawled out of, and leave the running of this
    country to his superiors.\u201D\r"
  - "A small cheer rings up from the crowd.\r"
  - "Marcelle studies your face intently for a moment and her voice suddenly fills
    with concern. \u201COh, you poor girl, don\u2019t look so hurt! Think of this
    as educational. You don\u2019t belong in Paris, the same way that a stray cat
    doesn\u2019t belong in that dress.\u201D She gestures dismissively at your finery.\r"
  - "\u201CNow pay attention, because I\u2019d hate for you to miss the point. If
    you should ever find your wandering Armand, tell him that he is an unwelcome,
    conniving weasel. In fact, both of you should go back to your petty little village,
    and leave Paris to your superiors.\u201D"
  - "\u201CNow leave my estate, and never show your face here again.\u201D"
  - '"Trying to look like us? Act like us? Stop. You''re just embarassing yourself."'
  - "\x1C\"Oh really, he insisted?\"\x1D Marcelle trills and her dog yips happily."
  - "\u201CWell I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here, and I\u2019m sure that he\u2019ll
    be well soon.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI mean, that\u2019s because we both know Armand\u2019s not sick.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CNobody\u2019s heard from your cowardly fiance in weeks, which is especially
    surprising, since he could never stop pestering his betters.\u201D The crowd,
    which only seems to be growing, murmurs in agreement. \u201CIn fact, it\u2019s
    been so long that I thought I was rid of him once and for all\u2026\u201D\r"
  - "\u201C...but now, I now have his cast off fiancee, who even had the audacity
    to lie to my face!\u201D"
  - "She pauses before speaking to you in a whisper loud enough for the entire room
    to hear. \u201CDon\u2019t worry, I don\u2019t expect you to understand this.\u201D\r"
  - "She advances on you, close enough to feel the heat of her breath. \u201CLet me
    be clear. You and your grasping, traitorous fiance are not guests in my home,
    nor will you ever be. I invited him here so I could express my displeasure to
    him in person.\u201D\r"
  - "\"\x1CI'\x19m so glad to see you. Armand, that ambitious little thing, has told
    me so much about you. In fact, I\x19'd say that he'\x19s quite infatuated with
    you. A common girl like yourself... you\x19're so lucky!\"\x1D\r"
