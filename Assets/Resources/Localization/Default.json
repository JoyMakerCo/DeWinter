  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.47": "Isaac winces as if he’d been cut. “I’m so sorry madame, that was very rude of me. It’s a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance.” ",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.48": "Isaac regards you warily as he continues. “Armand, I’ll keep this short. We all knew tensions were going to keep rising after the riots in Grenoble, but it’s happening faster than any of us would have ever imagined.” ",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.49": "Isaac looks back and forth between the two of you and gives a quick, formal bow.\n\n“You two are obviously in the middle of something important. Please excuse my intrusion. <i>Bonne nuit</i>.”",

  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.51": "Armand exhales and smiles, but there’s still an air of tension about him.\n\n“Not right now, no. It’s all… very vague at the moment. There’s so much going on that I don’t want to give you something new to worry about.”",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.52": "“That… was Isaac,” Armand says evenly. “I’ve been corresponding with him and some of his associates about politics for a few months now.",

  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.54": "“The general assembly might be the last chance to keep this country on the proper course, which means we can take absolutely no chances.” Isaac glances significantly to the package now in Armand’s hands.\n\nYour fiance is trying to look positive, but his expression falters slightly in the face of Isaac’s grave expression and warning.

  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.57": "“Isaac…” Armand presses at a louder volume, glancing towards you.",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.58": "“Armand, I know this is hard, but France itself is at stake here.” Isaac continues, oblivious to your presence. “We helped guarantee your election for our <i>Bailliage</i>, so you could do this for us. You said it yourself ‘We must-”",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.59": "“Isaac!” Armand barks sharply and suddenly. Even the crickets and the birds seem to go silent.",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.6": "He then fills his own, then raises his glass for a toast. “To France, to the general assembly, but most importantly, to us!”",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.60": "Breathing deeply, Armand recomposes himself, and gestures in your direction.\n\n“Isaac, have you met my fiance Yvette Decaux? We were just enjoying our last night together before I left to prepare for the general assembly.”",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.61": "Isaac’s eyes widen and he seemingly notices you for the first time. \n\n“Oh… hello Madame. I was just giving your fiance some important files that he forgot at home. Please excuse my intrusion. <i>Bonne nuit</i>.”",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.62": "“Ideas about modernity, monarchy, and what makes France different from the rest of the world.” Armand says, almost automatically, before looking away from you and blushing for a moment. His breath mists in the air, as he stares out across the still waters of the lake.",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.63": "Armand looks away, staring out across the lake. “It’s something… something that I cannot tell you about. Not yet.”",

  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.66": "“I know that isn’t the whole answer, or what you want to hear. However, I need you to trust me Yvette, please.”\n\nHis voice is serious. Grave. Pained.",

  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.7": "The red wine is deep and full bodied, it smells of leather, blackberries and cloves. It’s some of the best you’ve had, and you can tell that Armand is enjoying it as well. ",
  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.8": "You spend an hour finishing the bottle together, pausing occasionally to nibble at the bread.

  "Assets/Resources/Incidents/Back Then, Back Home.asset.node.9": "With the wine finished, Armand pauses to place the bottle on its side, a curious habit he picked up from his father.
