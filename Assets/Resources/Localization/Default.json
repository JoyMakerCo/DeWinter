  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.45": "He pulls you closer and stares out at the lake. “I know I’m doing the right thing for France by going, but I’m going to miss moments like this,” he sighs.\n\nArmand breathes deep, preparing himself for his next words.",

  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.41": "Your town is relatively small, and yet you still don’t recognize this man. ",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.40": "It’s then that a man stumbles out of the darkness towards you, glancing about himself, and trying to catch his breath. \n\n“Armand, I’ve been looking everywhere for you!” he whisper hoarsely. ",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.39": "You pull away from each other, and you stare into his eyes. His face is a mixture of excitement and surprise. He whispers to you “I hope every kiss we have is as good as that one.” \n\nArmand breathes deep, preparing himself for his next words.",

  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.37": "“Yvette, I-” Armand starts, but stops. His talent for words seems to have failed him. Instead, he leans in towards you, his eyes closed.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.36": "You sit on your newfound bench with Armand, your bodies close together for warmth. Side by side, you stare out at the lake. Its water is so still that it almost seems like a mirror, the luminous reflection of the full moon is only lightly obscured the by occasional passing motes of fog dancing across the lake’s surface.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.35": "He uses his sleeve to sweep the snow off the wide piece of stone, then gestures out towards the lake your town is built on the edge of.\n\n“Our new bench may not be the most prestigious real estate, but the view is quite nice, and the company’s the best in the world.” ",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.34": "You gently pull away and place a finger on his lips. He opens his eyes and blushes.\n\n“Of course, we could keep enjoying the view, for a little while longer...”",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.33": "Your lips meet his and a joyful shiver runs through your body. His hand comes up to stroke the side of your face as his other arm hugs you close. ",

  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.31": "Your head leans on his shoulder. His body feels both warm and familiar.\n\nThe moon is full, the town distant, and it feels like you’re the only two people in the entire world.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.30": "You walk along the edge of a lake, the only sound being the chirping of the crickets, the sounds of your footfalls, and the steady rhythm of each other’s breath.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.29": "Armand smiles, “Very well, Madame!”. \n\nThere’s not much in the way of benches outside the tavern, but he finds a stone mounting block a short distance from the tavern.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.28": "You step in close to him, wrapping your arm around his, before you both wander off into the moonlit night.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.27": "He turns and holds out his elbow for you to grab onto, “Care for a walk?”",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.26": "“While I like <i>Le Cygne</i> as much as the next man, I’d prefer to end our night with something that’s just about us.” Armand says in a soft, low voice.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.25": "Outside the night air is brisk, even the colors of the moonlit sky are cold. It’s a stark contrast from the fireside warmth of the tavern. Yet, despite the open air, it feels more intimate and personal than the small tavern you’ve left behind.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.24": "He then fills his own, then raises his glass for a toast. “To the loss of our hero, destroyed by that which he loved the most.”",

  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.17": "“Obviously, I would be unable to resist your charms. Perhaps… you would feel same?”",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.16": "Armand leans in, his eyebrow raised conspiratorially, “Ah, but your evil ways would not go unnoticed for long. The whole town would live in fear of you, and as the heir to this Barony I would have no choice but stop you myself. I would disguise myself as a huntsman, lost in the forest and pretend to be blissfully unaware of your wicked predations. While I would be unable to resist your charms, I feel that… you might feel the same way about me.”",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.15": "Armand is more animate now, his words coming out faster and faster “In that case, I shall have no choice but to disguise myself as a huntsman, lost in the forest, and happening upon your grand salon by chance. You might be intrigued by this curious outsider in your midst. This would lead us to talking amongst the birds, the deer, and your other refined guests about the natural order, and the beauties of the wilds.”",

  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.12": "He pauses, and takes a deep breath. “Enough of that! If I want to feel sorry for myself, I can do it on the carriage to Paris.

  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.11": "“I knew it...” Armand sighs, defeated.",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.10": "Armand gives an audible sigh of relief, while he usually cares about keeping his appointments, he rarely let’s something like this get to him. “I’m sorry, it’s just… the general assembly is so important, but so are you. I’m packing and writing letters night and day in order to get ready, but all the time I spend on that is time I’m not spending with you.”",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.9": "With the wine finished, Armand pauses to place the bottle on its side, a curious habit he picked up from his father. He then takes a deep breath, and waits a moment before saying “The snow appears to have stopped. Would you… would you like to join me outside? I have something I want to show you.”",
  "15502.Back Then, Back Home.node.8": "You spend an hour finishing the bottle together, pausing occasionally to nibble at the bread. All the while, you trade jokes, news from around the village, and simply try to forget that this is the last you’ll see of each other for months.",
