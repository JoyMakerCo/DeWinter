A small fireplace occupies one side of the room, with a wide swath of ash spilling out of the fireplace and onto the floor. Above the fireplace itself, a painting hangs on the mantle.",
  "The Abandoned Studio.node.28": "The entrance to the back room isn’t obvious and if Pierre hadn’t told you about it earlier, you might have mistaken it for a closet door. When you go to open the door, you notice that the latch has been torn off. Probably a casualty of the raid.",

  "The Abandoned Studio.node.22": "Now that you’re closer, you can see that the door has been nailed shut. Wordlessly, you and Hansel start checking the boards on the windows, seeing if any of them are loose. On the third window, you find one of boards easily gives way, like it’s been pulled out before.\n\nSomeone else has been here.",

  "The Bourgeois Militia.node.4": "Then again, a large amount of angry people doesn't make an army.

This opening has made made Talleyrand the new bishop, and given him all of the power he wanted. This includes a wealth of property, and a salary of nearly fifty thousrand livres a year. ",
  "The Bishop of Autun.node.3": "Unfortunately for him, it seems that Talleyrand's prayers have gone unanswered. While the Bishop of Autun has moved to Lyon, he's selected a different successor to his post. This has left the ambitious Talleyrand fuming, and the more orthodox members of the clergy laughing behind their hands.",
  "The Bishop of Autun.node.2": "However, actual advancement within the Church has evaded him for some time. While it's well known that he's been impatiently waiting for the Archbishop of Bourges to finally join the heavenly host, Talleyrand has also had his eye on the post of the Bishop of Autun.",
  "The Bishop of Autun.node.1": "While he's fulfilled his duties to the Church well, he's also been the subject of much scandal. Talleyrand believes that he embodies a modern system of Catholic values, including his preferences towards the needs of the common people over the nobility. However, these modern views seem to be dismissive of his vows of celibacy. Despite the infirmities that caused his family to dismiss him, he's still been considered quite desirable by many women in France, due to his kindness, erudition, and snapping witicisms.",
  "The Bishop of Autun.node.0": "Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, or simply 'Talleyrand' is figure of much discussion in France. Born as the scion to a powerful noble family, his foot was maimed at an early age in an accident. Unable to particapte in the courtly dances of the courtiers, or march adequately enough to serve in the military, he was deemed useless by his family. Thus, he was sent into the priesthood, like many unwanted sons of nobility.",

  "Epilogue.node.44": "Camille was overcome with joy to discover that not only did you survive your trial, but that you were intending on staying in Paris.",
  "Epilogue.node.43": "However, with the revolution's victory, she's been forced to reorganize her new creations around the new wave of somber and restrained fashions that have come in vogue. Sartorial excess is simply no longer what it used to be.",
  "Epilogue.node.42": "After the nobility's close call with consequences for their excesses, there has been a renewed interest in personal protection. More and more clients have ben requesting that Fatima use tightly stitched layers of silk to add 'armor' to their finery. It might even work.",

  "Epilogue.node.36": "With the revolution's victory, Antoine's political star rose like the fabled Icarus. He helped author the new constution, and became a prominent leader within an extremist political party known only as 'The Mountain'.",
  "Epilogue.node.35": "When the dream of revolution died, Antoine died with it. Armed guards stormed his modest apartment a few weeks ago. Instead of surrendering to the enemies of the people, he died trying to strangle the first man who attempted to arrest him.",

  "Epilogue.node.26": "While the <i>ancien regime</i> may have succesfully held onto power, Alex and his comrades still fought alongside revolutionary forces, hoping to bring about a new republic. He was killed in a skimish with mercenaries hired by the Crown.",
  "Epilogue.node.25": "Remaining loyal to the <i>ancien regime</i>, Alex fought against revolutionary forces all across France. He gained a reputation for being sympathetic to the plight of commoners caught up in the war, and was recently promoted to the rank of Sergeant.",

  "Epilogue.node.9": "You and Alex fled together. You may have discarded the city, but he left behind his duty, and any chance of claiming his title. While he may have been conflicted at first, over the last few days, he's seemed less and less bothered by this possibility.",
  "Epilogue.node.8": "You and Madame Gazel fled together. While most passengers of the various crowded vessels you've hopped between have slept out on the decks, she quicky decided that she would not countenance such a thing and routinely purchased a cabin for just the two of you.",
  "Epilogue.node.7": "You and Élisabeth fled together, to Rome. It's a bit of strange procession, between you, your servants, Élisabeth and her daughter, but you all manage to keep each other entertained during the long periods on the water. ",
