A cold breeze blows at your back and you look up at the charred hole in the roof of the building. This fire must have gotten large enough to set a portion of the ceiling ablaze.

  "theAbandonedStudio.node.36": "The paintings on the wall are all traditional historical pieces, exactly the sort of thing <i>L’Academie</i> exalts as ‘true art’. Judging by the stern faces and repeated images, you’re sure that the paintings are all meant to be some kind of political allegory, but you can’t really tell what of.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.35": "The desk by the door is so beautiful that it seems to clash with the rough practicality of the other furniture in the room. All of the drawers have been flung open, and papers have been scattered everywhere.",

  "theAbandonedStudio.node.29": "The stairs creak underneath your feet as you make your way to the second floor. The long table and scattered cutlery suggests that it was used as a dining area. A small fireplace occupies one side of the room, with a wide swath of ash spilling out of the fireplace and onto the floor. Above the fireplace itself, a painting hangs on the mantle.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.28": "The entrance to the back room isn’t obvious and if Pierre hadn’t told you about it earlier, you might have mistaken it for a closet door. When you go to open the door, you notice that the latch has been torn off. Probably a casualty of the raid.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.27": "Your time is limited, where do you plan on searching for clues?",

  "theAbandonedStudio.node.25": "From your position outside, you peer into the gloom and watch Hansel examine the room for a few moments before he gives a satisfied nod, dropping his hand from his weapon. Returning to the window, he grabs you by the waist, and easily helps you into the building.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.24": "He enters the building first, his face frozen in a grim expression that almost makes you feel bad for any dangerous persons you might encounter.\n\nAlmost.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.23": "You get Hansel’s attention, and he quietly takes down the boards, leaving them in a neat pile by the window to be put back later.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.22": "Now that you’re closer, you can see that the door has been nailed shut. Wordlessly, you and Hansel start checking the boards on the windows, seeing if any of them are loose. On the third window, you find one of boards easily gives way, like it’s been pulled out before.\n\nSomeone else has been here.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.21": "The mercenary crouches down and places his hand on the grip of his sabre. You hike up your skirts, and get ready to follow him. On his signal, you quietly dash across the street together, watching for any movement in the windows as your approach.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.20": "When you get to the window, Hansel’s hands emerge from the darkness and grab you by the waist, easily helping you into the building.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.19": "After what feels like an eternity, you see his hand emerge from the opened window and motion for you to approach. You hike up your skirts and quietly hurry across the street towards him.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.18": "Hansel gazes warily at the building before turning back to you. For a moment he looks like he’s about to object, but your mind is obviously made up. \n\n“Understood, madame. We go together.”",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.17": "Eventually, he finds that some of the boards covering one of the windows are loose, quietly pries them off, and easily hops through the window into the building inside. You catch glimpses of him through some of the other windows as he scouts out the darkened interior.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.16": "Crouching as low as his sizeable frame will allow, Hansel advances towards the building with his hand firmly on the grip of his sabre. He glances inside the windows and tries the door, which appears to be have been nailed shut.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.15": "“Madame, I’d like to inspect the building first. You never know who’s taken up residence in empty places like this.” ",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.14": "Inside, the studio is even darker than you would have guessed. Between the boards on the windows, and the lack of lighting in the surrounding street, it’s nearly impossible to pick out any detail smaller than the walls and doors.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.13": "You carefully ease yourself through the window, making sure none of your clothes get caught on any exposed nails. Once inside, you close your eyes for a few moments, so they’ll adjust to the darkness faster.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.12": "Gingerly, you take down each of the boards, leaving them in a neat pile by the window to be put back later. Secrets are easier to uncover when nobody knows that you’re looking at all.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.11": "Leaning back and craning your neck to examine the roof, you see there’s a hole big enough for you to enter the building through, but you don’t have a ladder, or any way to get up there. For a moment you consider trying to enter the building next door, so you can drop down onto the roof, but it’s better to do this as quickly as possible.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.10": "Putting down your unlit lantern, you start checking the boards on the windows, seeing if any of them are loose. On the third window, you find one set of boards easily gives way, like it’s been pulled out before.\n\nSomeone else has been here.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.9": "You immediately notice that the door’s been nailed shut.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.8": "Rather than stand around in the middle of a dark street, you hike up your skirts and hurry across the road to the studio.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.7": "Glancing around, you don’t see anyone at all, as if the King’s notice somehow closed the entire street. ",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.6": "Before you can step any further towards the closed building, Hansel steps in front of you.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.5": "Rounding a corner, you find yourself on an empty street, looking across the road at the studio. The windows of the small, two storey building have been boarded up, and there’s a charred hole in the roof. A sign nailed to the door reads ‘Closed! On orders of the King.’",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.4": "Rounding a corner, you find yourself on an empty street, looking across the road at the studio.

  "theAbandonedStudio.node.3": "Winding your way through the narrow streets, you can’t help but think about how out of the way this place would have been for Armand. Yet, Pierre said that he was still a regular visitor. Despite yourself, you find your heart beating faster and faster as you get closer to the abandoned studio.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.2": "You waited for sunset before you headed out, as it feels like these sort of things are better done under the cover of darkness. However, everything still feels too bright. Every hanging lantern, every candle-lit window, feels like an eye staring down at you.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.1": "The front of the building is the painting studio, the floors spattered with pigments, and still littered with the scraps of various art supplies. An ornate desk sits in the front of the room, near the door, with papers scattered all around it. A few finished canvases still remain on the walls, though it looks like a lot of the others were either seized or destroyed.",
  "theAbandonedStudio.node.0": "Tugging on the edges of your hood to make sure your face is hidden from view, you glance down again at the hastily scribbled address Pierre gave you in his office.

  "theFinalSitting.node.59": "It's Élisabeth's version of you, and while she isn't in the portrait itself, you can see so much of her personality in the painting. You look relaxed and confident, but adorned with an enigmatic smile and eyes that seems to be looking somewhere else. ",
  "theFinalSitting.node.58": "You asked Élisabeth to give you perfection and she delivered it unto you. Every beauty has been refined, and every flaw erased. You may be nude in the painting, but you feel as regal as any monarch laden with jewels, silks, and ermine.",

  "primedAndReady.node.14": "\"Pelletier has done that?\" He asks, his attempt at a neutral expression betrayed by the newly emerged beads of sweat upon his brow.",
  "primedAndReady.node.13": "\"Should I know you?\" He asks.",
  "primedAndReady.node.12": "Michael leaves, which also fees you to approach the subject of your plot.",
  "primedAndReady.node.11": "He whispers his plan to you and it's extremely simple. Goad this choleric individual into challenging Michael to a duel, then appear later to witness the scene as the man is arrested for his murderous intents.",
  "primedAndReady.node.10": "Honestly, Michael's offer is rather paltry. However, you also know that if you follow up on this story as it develops, the gossip generated by it could be amazing.",

  "primedAndReady.node.5": "\"Can you help? I can't be seen provoking him, or the plan will fail.\"",
  "primedAndReady.node.4": "\"Still, his bellicose bombast has inspired me. I need to goad him into challenging me to a duel. This should be easy because he dueled quite frequently in the army. It may be legal in that profession, but in our world, it's quite the crime.\"",
  "primedAndReady.node.3": "Apparently, it is, because he continues. \"I've managed to make myself a new romantic rival. The subject of our mutual affections is one Hortense du Montet. Hortense has been quite indecisive in declaring her intentions, but I think it's because my rival terrifies her.\"",

  "primedAndReady.node.0": "While you search for the latest goings on, you're approached by Michael Pelletier, the young chemistry student. Strangely enough, you've never seen him actually do anything even remotely close to his alleged studies.",

  "primedAndReady.link.24": "\"Hansel, it's a necessary tradition. It keeps things under control.\"",
