        it, even more than usual. Armand usually preferred to write volumes, a habit
        you would playfully tease him over in your own letters to him.


        ''My Dearest Yvette,


        I know it may be sudden, but I want to invite you to live with me in Paris.''


        When you first got the letter, you were afraid to ask your parents for their
        approval. However, when you finally got up the nerve, they didn''t just approve,
        they practically threw you onto the first carriage heading for Paris. You
        couldn''t help but be a little annoyed by their eagerness to see you off.'

        Armand had moved north to Paris to pursue his dreams of changing the country.
        You mailed love letters soaked in perfume, he replied with envelopes overflowing
        with pages about how much he missed you. The romance of it all helped make
        up for the inconvenience. \n\nTo your parents, the romance was secondary.
        Armand is a Baron, you're a commoner. The advantages this marriage would bring
        to your family were obvious. "
