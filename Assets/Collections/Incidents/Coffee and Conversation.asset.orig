        Given the rising tensions, patriotically minded people are asking where the
        loyalties of French priests lie. After all, the Catholic Church is a foreign
        government with its own laws. More pious citizens are saying that even asking
        that question is blasphemy, and that a priest''s first duty is always to the
        people of thier parish. '

        Times have been hard for the poorest people of Paris and some believe that
        the richest members of the common people have a duty to provide food and other
        assistance to the poor. Others are saying that without the nobility or the
        church paying taxes, the wealthiest commoners are already paying the lion's
        share of taxes and can't afford to keep giving away their money.

  _nodeText:
  - Strolling through the sixth <i>arrondissement</i>, you weave your way through
    crowds of excited students, pontificating intellectuals, and agitated artists.
    It feels like every corner is home to another gallery, or part of the various
    academies strewn throughout the district.
  - "Your nose picks up the scent of fine coffee and you find yourself subconsciously
    gravitating towards the origin of this delightful smell. The closer you get to
    the source of the scent, the thicker the crowds become.\r"
  - "Eventually, you arrive at a bustling coffee house with large glass windows. The
    sign outside reads '<i>Cafe Principe</i>'. Your heart sinks at the site of the
    massive crowd of students milling around outside the cafe. It doesn\u2019t look
    like you\u2019ll be able to get in at all.\r"
  - "However, before you can give up on this venture, a woman in a coffee stained
    apron emerges from the door. She loudly asks if any of the students are actually
    interested in buying anything, or if they\u2019re just hanging around to look
    important."
  - 'Sensing the hostility in this rhetorical question, the students quickly dissipate.
    Satisfied, the woman in the apron heads back inside. With the doorway cleared,
    you happily enter <i>Cafe Principe</i>. '
  - 'Inside, the coffee house is packed with customers engaged in animate conversation
    and gesticulating wildly with cups of steaming coffee. Growing up, you were often
    told that religion and politics made for poor conversation, but it appears that
    none of these people got the same message. '
  - "Finding a seat at an empty table, you\u2019re approached by the woman from before.\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Bonjour</i> madame, my name is Marguerite and let me be the first to
    welcome you to <i>Cafe Principe</i>!\u201D "
  - "\u201CWhat can I get you?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, certainly madame!\u201D she replies happily."
  - "\u201C...\u201D"
  - "You gesture around the cafe as you ask the question, and the woman follows your
    gesture as it accidentally points towards a portly older man surrounded by a group
    of politely giggling young women. \u201COh, that?\u201D she asks. \u201CThat man
    is Monsieur Boehmer, he\u2019s a regular.\u201D "
  - 'She gives you a quick curtsey before she checks in with another table, taking
    their order as well. You sigh and take in the cafe around you. The whole place
    hums with excitement, as patrons make new pronouncements and trade verbal barbs
    with their compatriots. '
  - "She returns with your coffee, steaming and hot. The porcelain cup clinks lightly
    as she sets it down, along with containers of sugar and milk. \r"
  - "Before you mix in anything, you decide to taste the coffee by itself. It\u2019s
    bitter and acidic, but also full and potent. Very potent. You now understand why
    the customers are all so energetic.\r"
  - "\u201CIf you insist, madame, I\u2019ll leave you to your refreshments.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Oui</i>, madame. I shall fetch you free water, while you occupy a table
    in our busy cafe.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIs there anything else I can get you?\u201D\r"
  - With a scowl, she skulks away to attend to the other customers, while you applaud
    yourself for your thriftiness. She shortly returns with your water, which is surprisingly
    cool and refreshing.
  - "Instantly, the woman is all smiles, once again. \u201COh yes, an excellent choice
    madame!\u201D"
  - '"As for the women, they are... prostitutes."'
  - "At the sound of fresh giggling from Monsieur Boehmer\u2019s table she leans in
    close to you and whispers behind her hand \u201CHe\u2019s not actually that funny,
    the laughing is just good for business.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIs there anything else you\u2019d like to know about?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, the cafe!\u201D the woman exclaims, suddenly understanding your point.
    \u201CDon\u2019t worry, everything here is pretty simple, I\u2019ve watched it
    play out with our patrons the same way everyday, for the last few years.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CFirst you come in and sit down, and order something. While we can\u2019t
    make you order anything, we would strongly prefer that you order some coffee.\u201D
    She stops to stare at you significantly for a moment. "
  - "\u201CAfter you get your drink, you can settle in alongside our patrons here.
    They're all obsessed with politics, so it\u2019s easy to find out who among the
    high and mighty is doing well at the moment. Everything's always shifting in Paris,
    so it\u2019s nice to come in regularly, and stay informed.\""
  - "\"Once you\u2019ve listened for a while, you\u2019ll probably get dragged into
    one of the debates. Be carefully with your answer, as news travels fast. Depending
    on who you support, you can earn favor with people from one facrion, but lose
    it with another.\""
  - "\u201CAfter that? You head home with a little more energy, a little more knowledge,
    and hopefully you\u2019re a little more well liked. That\u2019s all there is,
    really!\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CNow, if you can excuse me madame, I must get back to my other tables.\u201D"
  - "She favors you with a quick curtsey before leaving, and you get settled in. It
    feels famili, like a louder and livelier version of <i>\u2018Le Cygne\u2019</i>,
    the tavern you used to frequent back home"
  - "You sip at your drink, and get settled in. It feels familiar, like a louder and
    livelier version of <i>\u2018Le Cygne\u2019</i>, a tavern you used to frequent
    back home."
  - "Taking out your journal and a pencil, you close your eyes and relax, just listening
    to the bustling cafe. Not focusing on one individual, but letting the sum total
    of the room flow into your ears, and assessing it all together. Occasionally,
    you open your eyes to jot down notes.\r"
  - "It doesn\u2019t take long to realize that the Crown isn\u2019t just more powerful
    than the Revolution, but that the difference in power is massive. The nationalists
    in the Third Estate have quite a fight ahead of them if they want to make the
    Crown give into their demands. \r"
  - "After a few minutes, it becomes obvious that the Crown is significantly more
    powerful than the Revolution. While it might be possible for the Revolution to
    make the Crown give into their demands, they would have to build strong alliances
    with the other factions in order to do so. \r"
  - "It takes a while before you come to the conclusion that the Crown is barely more
    powerful than the Revolution. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t take much for the Crown
    to find themselves on their back foot. Maintaining strong alliances from the other
    factions will be important to their success.\r"
  - "You listen for what feels like an hour and you still can\u2019t draw a solid
    conclusion. The Crown and the Revolution are so evenly matched that you can\u2019t
    determine which would prevail in any sort of conflict. The victor would most certainly
    be determined by the strength of their alliances.\r"
  - "Opening your eyes, you switch your focus to something more specific. You scan
    the room, looking at everyone's manner of dresse and body language. You'\x19re
    looking for more subtle hints about where everyone'\x19s allegiances lie. More
    notes quickly scratched into your journal.\r"

    the Revolution\u2019s demands, they would have to build strong alliances with
    the other factions in order to do so. \r"
  - "It doesn\u2019t take long to realize that the Revolution isn\u2019t just more
    powerful than the Crown, but that the difference in power is massive. The royal
    family and their loyal aristocrats have quite a fight ahead of them if they want
    to resist the Revolution\u2019s demands. \r"

  - "Having reasoned that the Church is the most powerful of the minor factions in
    Paris, you glance over your notes and instantly come to the conclusion that they\u2019ve
    put their entire support behind the King and the aristocracy."
  - "Quickly scanning over your meticulous notes, you\u2019re quite certain that the
    Church is the most powerful of all the minor factions in Paris. Additionally,
    it seems that they strongly support the Royal family."
  - "After some consideration, you deduce that the Church is the most powerful minor
    faction in Paris. They support the Crown for now, but it wouldn\u2019t take much
    to swing the balance."
  - While you can easily conclude that the Church is the most powerful minor faction
    in Paris, you have a hard time determining whether they support the Crown or the
    Revolution more. It seems that their allegiance is currently up for grabs by either
    party.
  - "After some consideration, you deduce that the Church is the most powerful minor

  - "Having reasoned that the Church is the most powerful of the minor factions in
    Paris, you glance over your notes and instantly come to the conclusion that they\u2019ve

  - "Glancing through your notes, you note that the Church and Military are the most
    powerful of the minor factions in Paris. Not only that, they\u2019re both loyal
    to the Crown. While you can\u2019t determine anything more specific than that,
    it\u2019s still valuable information."
  - "Glancing through your notes, you note that the Church and Military are the most

    side of the Revolution. While you can\u2019t determine anything more specific
    than that, it\u2019s still valuable information."
  - "Examining your notes more thoroughly, you can tell that the Church and Military
    are the most powerful of the minor factions in Paris. You can even tell that one
    of them is loyal to the Crown, while the other is siding with the Revolution.
    Unfortunately, you can\u2019t figure out which is which. Too much noise."
  - "Glancing through your notes, you note that the Church and Bourgeoisie are the

    Unfortunately, you can\u2019t figure out which is which. Too much noise."
  - Now that you have your bearings, politically, you start becoming a little more
    involved with your fellow patrons.
  - "Frowning in irritation, you look down at your notes and realize that there\x19's
    no clear pattern in anything you'\x19ve seen. It seems like the minor factions
    of the city are nearly equal in power, and this jumble makes it difficult to discern
    any additional information about them."
  - 'Someone is reading loudly from a pamphlet extolling the virtues of the king as
    the surrogate father of the nation, but nobody''s really paying attention to him. '
  - A man in the corner keeps trying to use verses from the Bible to justify the Church's
    right to avoid taxation, but it's hard to hear him over the sound of jeering patrons.
  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Church and the Crown. Some aristocrats
    are angry that the first estate is allowed to send priests that weren't born in
    France as representatives to the Estates General.
  - A disheveled woman is banging her fist on her table, claiming that officials who
    fail to pay the army's wages on time are actually theives.
  - A lawyer is trying to convince people that taxes should be reformed according
    to 'natural law', but nobody seems able to agree on what natural law is.
  - A young woman is flitting between tables, discreetly distributing revolutionary
    flyers. The owner is pretending not to see her do this.
  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Church and the Crown. Some aristocrats
    are angry that the first estate is allowed to send priests that weren't born in
    France as representatives to the Estates General.
  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Military and the Crown. Aristocratic
    officers are lobbying the king for the right to dress as they please at court,
    instead of wearing their uniforms. They feel that being forced to wear military
    livery casts them as servants, instead of leaders. The generals are obviously
    unhappy about this.

    little more knowledge than you had before.

  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Military and the Crown. Aristocratic
    officers are lobbying the king for the right to dress as they please at court,
    instead of wearing their uniforms. They feel that being forced to wear military
    livery casts them as servants, instead of leaders. The generals are obviously
    unhappy about this.
  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Bourgeoisie and the Crown. Merchants
    in France want the taxes to be simplified, to make it easier to move goods around
    the country. The aristocrats say that the current system keeps the economy stable.

    Nationalists want to move France towards a constitutional government, but monarchists
    claim that France is in too tumultuous a state for such a radical transition.

  - You get drawn into a conversation about the Military and the Bourgeoisie. Due
    to skipped wages, soldiers have become notoriously delinquent on their debts,
    and some have even reacted violently when asked to pay. This has led to some shop
    owners refusing to do business with soldiers at all. Nobody's certain if that's
    right, or even legal.

    already pay enough, and can't afford to keep giving away their money.
