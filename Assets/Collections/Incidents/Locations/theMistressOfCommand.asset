  _nodeText:
  - Hastily walking to Madame Gazel's home with your hood up, you realize that you've
    never actually been there before. Thankfully, you've already memorized her address
    from all the letters she's sent you.
  - Of course, even if you didn't know the address already, you'd certainly be able
    to recognize the place. An elaborate, fashionable rococo building sits back from
    the street and behind a gate. The windows are shrouded by gauzy black curtains.
  - It's like someone modeled the building on her.
  - You go to knock on the gate, but it opens before you can touch it.
  - "With a thin smile, the ever-silent Ren\xE9 waves you in, and leads you beyond
    the gate and into the house."
  - No tour of the house is provided, but you do stroll through the dining room and
    the salon towards the garden in the back. You're offered a glass of wine from
    an impressively dusty bottle, which you take. It's simply nice to be prepared.
  - "You arrive in the gardens, which are filled with a combination of blooming roses
    and lillies. The scent is almost overwhelming. Ren\xE9 indicates to Madame Gazel,
    who is waiting on a chaise longue at the center of the garden. A table is set
    up next to her, draped in a black sheet. She hasn't noticed you."
  - He bows, and begins to dismiss himself.
  - He smiles his same thin smile, but his eyes have more emotion in them than before.
  - "As Ren\xE9 walks away, you head inside to Madame Gazel. She is reading by a
    lantern amongst the flowers. A single spot of sumptuous darkness, in a halo of
    light."
  - "His eyes widen as you produce the black satin oufit that Madame Gazel gave you,
    so long ago. Ren\xE9 smiles, broadly and genuinely."
  - "Looking around, expecting some sort of specter or sorcery at play, you instead
    notice Madame Gazel's servant, Ren\xE9. You're especially surprised to notice
    that he's no longer wearing his black armband."
  - You step back inside for a few minutes, and while his help isn't as quick as
    Camille's, or as sensual as Madame Gazel's, you still find yourself dressed and
    looking as amazing as ever.
  - Back in the garden, she is waiting on her chaise longue. Reading by a lantern
    amongst the flowers. A single spot of sumptuous darkness, in a halo of light.
  - 'You step out of the darkness, suddenly appearing before her dressed in the vision
    that she imagined for you. '
  - For once, in all of the time that you've known her, you have truly caught her
    off guard.
  - Her eyes drink you in, deeply and hungrily as she stalks towards you. "You, my
    darling Yvette, are a vision."
  - '"That you would even think to..." She trails off, holding the edge of your midnight-colored
    skirt between thumb and forefinger.'
  - '"<i>Merveilleuse</i>..."'
  - (You have gained quite a bit of favor with Madame Gazel)
  - '"But let''s focus on tonight." She purrs, tracing a finger across the table
    concealed by the sheet. "After all, I finally have you all to myself..."'
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - Out in the garden, Madame Gazel is waiting on her chaise longue. Reading by lantern
    light amongst the flowers. A single spot of sumptuous darkness in a halo of light.
  - Her servant leads you out to her, signaling your presence. Looking up, she closes
    her book with a crisp snap.
  - '"Yvette, I''m so glad you came."'
  - Silently, you step out of the darkness, suddenly appearing before her. She looks
    up from her book and smiles.
  - '"Oh Yvette, I''m ever so glad that you''re here." Madame Gazel murmurs, closing
    her book with a crisp snap.'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - '"I have to ask, what brought you here? Why come at all?"'
  - Right as you start to speak she shushes you "Wait, wait, wait..."
  - Reaching past you, she plucks a lily from the garden and carefully places it
    in your hair.
  - '"Much better." She says with a devilish grin. "Now you may speak, my sweet Yvette."'
  - Right as you start to speak she shushes you "Wait, wait, wait..."
  - She sighs, trying not to sound exasperated.
  - '"If you must know, I was invited to meet with all the pillars of the Bourgeoisie
    tomorrow, to discuss where we stand in regards to the Crown and the Revolution.
    They''ve been impressed by my business acumen, which means they now care about
    my opinion."'
  - Reaching past you, she plucks a lily from the garden and carefully places it
    in your hair.
  - '"Much better." She says with a devilish grin. "Now you may speak, my sweet Yvette."'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - Somewhat flustered, you start again on how you were powerless to resist her,
    but it feels so unnecessary right after she'd so effortless overruled you. Still,
    you can tell that she likes watching you squirm.
  - Somewhat flustered, you start again on how you came here for love, but it feels
    so unnecessary right after she'd starting arranging flowers in your hair. Still,
    you can tell that she appreciates the effort.
  - (You have gained some favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - She pulls you closer, and your hands are on each other's bodies. None of your
    movements feel like your own. Instead you feel like she is guiding you this way
    and that. You close your eyes as your lips meet.
  - As your eyes open, you see Madame Gazel pulling the black sheet from the tables,
    revealing a series of items. Your eyes mostly focus on the lengths of sturdy
    black ribbon, and the riding crop. Glancing around, you also realize that no
    windows from any of the neighboring buildings face this garden.
  - '"Yvette, I will say this plainly. I trust you. How much do you trust me?"'
  - '"I''m very glad to hear that." She says in a low growl, taking your chin between
    her thumb and forefinger. "Don''t worry, I will never ask you to do anything
    you don''t want to. However, you may find yourself wanting to do things you never
    expected."'
  - '"That is very understandable," She says with an indulgent smile. "I will never
    ask you to do anything you don''t want to."'
  - She sighs and shakes her head, covering the table with the sheet. "If that is
    the case, then we will do none of these things. Without trust, they are simply
    more dangerous than pleasurable."
  - '"I may, however..." She says, tightening a length of ribbon between her hands.
    "Leave you wanting more."'
  - 'She seizes you, and pushes you down face first onto the chaise longue. You hear
    the creak of tightening leather as she clenches the riding crop in her hand. '
  - It is a confusing night, but it feels good. Impossibly so, like you're deceiving
    the entire world to do it. In fact, the two of you are so caught up in your play
    together that you don't even leave the garden.
  - Hours later, you are exhausted, sore, and consumed by heady bliss. Naked, the
    two of you fall asleep on the chaise longue together, using only each other's
    body heat to keep warm.
  - You wake up in the middle of the night. Madame Gazel is still asleep next to
    you, snoring slightly.
  - With a quiet yawn, you lay back down and snuggle up to Madame Gazel again. Without
    even waking up, her arms slip around you. Protectively, possessively.
  - 'Quietly slipping into the bare minimum of clothing, you leave the garden and
    let yourself back into the house. '
  - You explore for a while and find the entire house still and silent. You're the
    only person awake, but you also know that you could be caught at any moment.
  - Once again, you fall fast asleep, warmed only by the body of another.
  - Awoken by the chill of an early morning breeze, you find yourself still on the
    same chaise longue. This time you're alone and covered with a light blanket.
    It's black, like everything else Madame Gazel owns.
  - '"Your timing is impeccable as always, I have a very important meeting tomorrow,
    which will consume a lot of my time in the near future."'
  - '"In fact, I''m so nervous that I''ll say something wrong that I spent all day
    in my study today, writing notes for the meeting."'
  - "Looking up at the sound of approaching footsteps, you find Ren\xE9 studiously
    averting his eyes as he brings you a nice breakfast on a silver tray."
  - (You have gained some favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Madame Gazel)
  - The two of you spend the next few minutes archly flirting, but you can tell that
    she's having some difficulty focusing. It appears that your question has dredged
    up some of her more anxious thoughts.
  - "Bundling yourself up in the sheet, you take the tray from him, and begin your
    breakfast. The good food is made better by the fact that you're extremely hungry.
    There's a note on the tray, hastily written, but still smelling of Madame Gazel's
    perfume. \n\nYou open it."
  - '''My darling Yvette,

    I''m sorry that I''m gone, but I had to leave for
    an important meeting. Sometimes business truly does come before pleasure. I wanted
    to say that last night was amazing, and I look forward to playing with you again.'''
  - (You have gained a lot of favor with Madame Gazel)
  - "Ren\xE9 departs and you take the time to savor your breakfast before you get
    dressed and head home. It's still so early that the only people on the streets
    are the ones that fell asleep there last night."
  - It's just you, your thoughts, and some truly interesting memories.
  - Your head still lost in the bliss of last night, you stumble home with the grace
    of a tipsy dancer. Every movement joyous, every thought elsewhere. You never
    imagined that your life would lead you here, but you're glad that it has.
  - Frustrated by the frailties of your own heart, you head home. Glaring into the
    middle distance, you wonder what secrets awaited you in Madame Gazel's home,
    unlocked and unguarded.
  - "'To be honest I never thought I'd be able to trust someone again the way that
    I now trust you.\n\nLove, \n\nMadame Gazel.'"
  - Her wicked smile returns "Yet, we still have romance."
  - She steps closer to you, and places a hand on the back of your head, holding
    you firmly in place while she kisses you. Her other hand traces the exposed skin
    at the neckline of your dress.
  - It's a fun night, though it is often punctuated by pauses where Madame Gazel
    checks in to make sure that you're alright. A calm and powerful demeanor, occasionally
    punctured by bouts of nervousness. Naked, the two of you eventually fall asleep
    on the chaise longue together, using only each other's body heat to keep warm.
  - (You have gained a little peril)
  - After some careful searching, you find your way into Honorade's study. The low
    embers of a nearly dead fire cast the room in a soft light, and her desk is strewn
    with papers.
  - Thinking better of snooping through her things, you return to the garden, and
    to Madame Gazel, who is still sleeping soundly. You strip back down again, so
    as to avoid arousing suspicion.
  - Cautiously and always keeping an eye on the door, you take a few minutes to rifle
    through her papers. It looks like Madame Gazel is expected to speak on how the
    Bourgeoisie should side in the public conversation about the Crown and the nationalists
    in the Revolution.
  - All of her notes point towards her urging them to support the Crown.
  - Her notes are muddled, and it doesn't look like she's been able to come to a
    decision herself.
  - All of her notes point towards her urging them to support the Revolution.
  - Examining the notes, you decide against engaging in any more subterfuge. Carefully
    putting everything back where you found it, you return to the garden, and to
    Madame Gazel. You strip back down again, so as to avoid arousing suspicion.
  - Discreetly and carefully, you pull a pen from the ink well and start to alter
    her notes. After all, you've seen enough of her letters to learn her handwriting.
    Before long, you've added in a few more points on why the Bourgeoisie would only
    thrive underneath a Revolutionary government, free from the shackles of the lazy
    nobility.
  - While it's possible to alter the tone of her notes, you could never switch their
    political sentiments entirely. You cannot have her adding her support to the
    Revolution, which means there's only one solution.
  - '(The Bourgeoisie has moved towards the Revolution significantly)

    (You have
    gained some peril)'
  - Carefully putting everything back where you found it, you return to the garden,
    and to Madame Gazel. You strip back down again, so as to avoid arousing suspicion.
  - Getting down on hand and knee, you stoke the embers in the fireplace back to
    life. One at a time, you feed Madame Gazel's notes into the flames, then muddle
    the ashes afterwards. Nobody will suspect a thing, she'll simply be unprepared
    for a meeting, and unable to make herself heard.
  - '(The Bourgeoisie has moved away from the Revolution a little)

    (The Bourgeoisie
    has lost some power)

    (You have gained quite a bit of peril)'
  - You find a nearby pitcher of water and scrub all the soot from your hands before
    returning to the garden. Madame Gazel is still asleep on the chaise longue, but
    shifts occasionally, fitfully. You strip back down again, so as to avoid arousing
    suspicion.
  - Discreetly and carefully, you pull a pen from the ink well and start to alter
    her notes. After all, you've seen enough of her letters to learn her handwriting.
    Before long, you've added in a few more points on why the Bourgeoisie can only
    thrive underneath the stability of the Crown's rightful rule.
