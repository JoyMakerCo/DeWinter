  _nodeText:
  - You wander the city for a while, and before you realize it, the sun is already
    setting and you have accomplished nothing particularly useful. With darkness
    upon you, you find yourself at the docks, and its normal hustle and bustle is
    replaced with an eerie quiet.
  - Paying a little more attention to your surroundings, you spot a figure moving
    in the darkness. However, this shape seems somewhat familiar.
  - Is that Antoine? What is he doing here, skulking in the dark?
  - You hide behind an overturned boat and stare into the inky blackness, watching
    carefully for any sort of movement. He appears to be furiously rummaging amongst
    some rocks on the river's edge. Suddenly, you see a glint of reflected moonlight
    as he retrieves a glass bottle, extracts some rolled-up paper from it, and begins
    to read it by the light of the moon.
  - It's then that you see an officer of the <i>Guet Royal</i> approaching Antoine's
    position. He's not moving directly towards the young revolutionary. Rather, the
    watchman appears to be stumbling blindly through the dark. However, he is growing
    dangerously close.
  - He could be upon Antoine at any moment...
  - Without a second thought, you pull up the hood of your cloak and rush forward
    to his position in the dark. Startled, an angry voice yells out "What the devil?
    You there! Halt, in the name of the King!"
  - You see the watchman stumble upon Antoine, who seems rather annoyed with this
    turn of events.
  - (You have gained a decent amount of peril)
  - Looking up at the sound of the commotion following you, Antoine stops his reading
    long enough to frantically stuff the letters into his coat. "Yvette? What are
    you doing here?"
  - '"Go tell your king to catch me himself, you blockheaded lout!" Antoine snarls
    as he takes off running.'
  - Just as Antoine sprints away, you see the papers flutter from his grasp. The
    wind takes these errant pages, and scatters them across the river. Even from
    this distance, you can hear Antoine utter a barrage of curses at this latest
    turn of fortune.
  - (The Revolution has lost a little power)
  - '"<i>Merde!</i>" Antoine snarls while grabbing you by the hand. "We need to leave
    Yvette, and now!"'
  - '"Go tell your king to catch us himself, you blockheaded lout!" Antoine laughs,
    as you both take off running.'
  - This merry chase between Antoine and the watchman endures for a while, eventually
    coming to an end when the <i>Guet Royal</i> Sergeant manages to twist his ankle
    on a stone and fall in the river. Hobbled, waterlogged, and generally defeated,
    he resorts to flailing around in the water and shouting invectives at the fleeing
    Antoine. It's not very effective.
  - '"Alright, you two! I don''t know what''s going on here, but I do know that you''re
    both coming with me!"'
  - Antoine runs off into the night, unaware that you were ever even there.
  - Well, that was interesting. You have no idea what fresh hell Antoine was up to,
    but you simply don't have the luxury to take those kind of risks, right now.
    You go home and consider the events of the night.
  - Running as fast as you can, the two of you manage to lead the warman on a merry
    chase. This comes to an end when the <i>Guet Royal</i> Sergeant manages to twist
    his ankle on a stone and fall in the river. Hobbled, waterlogged, and generally
    defeated, he resorts to flailing around in the water and shouting invectives
    in your direction. It's not very effective.
  - '"What the devil are you doing out here, prowling about in the middle of the
    night? I don''t know what this is, but I know that you''re coming with me, in
    the name of the King!"'
  - Once you're certain that you're not being followed anymore, the two of you eventually
    come to a slow halt. "I must say, I didn't expect you to come to my rescue. You're
    not half bad, are you?"
  - "\"Ah, but of course, madame!\" Th\xE9r\xE8se says, stepping out of the shadows."
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - '"So, Yvette... why, exactly, did you render me that assistance?"'
  - '"Oh, well, you didn''t have to do that..." Antoine replies, a little stunned.
    "I''m quite capable on my own..."'
  - '"Well, I''m still glad that you''re here. I''d hate to have had my work disturbed
    by one of those loutish, corrupt bullies."'
  - '"You want the papers?" He asks, and you notice the shine of steel, tucked up
    one of his sleeves.'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You've gained a little credibility)
  - (You have gained a little peril)
  - Slowly, relucatantly, he relaxes. "Then again, I suppose you've earned the right
    to know some of this, at least."
  - '"In addition to my normal, revolutionary activities, I''ve been keeping track
    of a variety of fringe political groups. The Jansenists have always been a potential
    threat, among others. However, it appears that one of my contacts has come across
    something new... something strange."'
  - '"Nevertheless you''ve done me a great favor, so I must insist that I be allowed
    to walk you home, as thanks."'
  - True to his word, Antoine escorts you home through the dark city, staying extremely
    close. You can tell from his breathing that, despite his cool demeanor, he's
    still on edge from having been so close to being apprehended by the authorities.
  - He turns away from you, and like a spectre, he disappears into the night.
  - '"<i>Bonne nuit</i>, Yvette." He says with respectful upwards nod, before disappearing
    into the night.'
  - With that, you head inside, and go to bed. While your day may have been uneventful,
    it seems that your night has given you plenty to consider.
  - '"There''s a small group of intellectuals who have been spreading word of a ''political
    third option''. Something distinct from both our tyrannical monarchy, and our
    enlightened future as a republic. What''s worrying is that they''re actually
    gaining favor among certain disaffected nobles, mayors and judges."'
  - She then slips away from you and intercepts the officer of the <i>Guet Royale</i>.
    While he's surprised at first, they begin to have a conversation in hushed tones.
    Soon, he starts to walk away, laughing merrily all the while. Moments like this
    are exactly why you employ a Spy Mistress.
  - '"Now that I''ve taken care of that, I''ll hang back, and remain discreet."'
  - 'She retreats into the shadows, while you approach Antoine, who is in the process
    of secreting the retrieved papers in his coat. '
  - '"Madame, take the credit. After all, two heads cannot wear a crown." She replies
    with a fleeting hint of a smile. "You''re my employer, and I would be a poor
    spy mistress indeed, if I sought glory."'
  - '"Experience is commonly a virtue of age, madame. I''m certain that you''ll be
    adept at such things, soon enough."'
  - '"I must say, Yvette, I didn''t expect you to come to my rescue. You''re not
    half bad, are you?" Antoine says, watching the shadow of the watchman recede
    into the distance.'
  - '"I don''t know much else about them, other than the fact that this group is
    run by a woman named ''Madame du Jardin''... if that''s her real name."'
  - '"That''s all I know for the moment. The only thing I''m really certain of, is
    that these people are dangerous. Not just to our dreams of a Republic, but to
    all of France."'
  - Without a word, Antoine leans close enough to you that his lips are but a hair's
    breadth from your own. You can feel the heat of his body, so close to yours,
    burning like a raging inferno. His eyes look deeply into your own, and you find
    yourself struggling so as not to shrink away from the intensity of his gaze.
  - '"I shall have to thank you properly, one day, but for now I must go. <i>Bonne
    nuit</i>, Yvette."'
