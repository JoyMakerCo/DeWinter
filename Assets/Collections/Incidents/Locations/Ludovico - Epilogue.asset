  _nodeText:
  - You hurry south through the city, trying to make sure that you make it to the
    docks in time.
  - You've already lost a lot of time from having to double back and find new routes.
    It looks like new barricades are going up every day, and the streets simply don't
    feel safe anymore.
  - Finally, you make it to the docks. Instead of the normal bevy of merchant vessels,
    you only see barges taking on passengers, laden with their world possessions.
    The barges will take them via the river to a proper port city. Most people with
    the means to leave Paris, are leaving France altogether.
  - You spot Ludovico walking down from a gangplank, and peering into the crowd. When
    he spots you, his face blossoms into an exuberant smile.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)
  - He pushes through the crowd to get to you. "Yvette! I'm so glad you came. You
    have no idea how much this means to me."
  - 'However, his joy quickly fades, as he remembers what you''re both here to do. '
  - '"I guess, this is goodbye."'
  - Unable to restrain yourself further, you grab Ludovico by the wrist and lead him
    behind a nearby building for one last embrace.
  - The two of you sit on a the edge of the dock together. You laugh and joke, you
    talk about which books you've been reading recently. Together, you pretend that
    nothing is ever going to change.
  - You kiss with that passion which can only come from desperation. You drink deep
    of each other, unsure if this will be your last chance to ever do so.
  - It isn't a painful delusion, because you both know it isn't real. You feel at
    peace. You feel some of the danger of the last few days slip away, and gain a
    sort of clarity.
  - (You have lost some peril)
  - '"<i>Attention</i>!" Shouts the captain of Ludovico''s boat above the din of the
    crowd. "We''re getting ready to cast off. Those who are not on this vessel in
    three minutes will be left behind." He says with the finality of someone who has
    actually abandoned passengers before.'
  - You stop for a moment, not because you want to, but because you both need to beathe
    in order to live.
  - "\"This is it. <i>\rArrivederci, Yvette.</i>\""
  - '"I love you." He says, one last time before boarding his boat.'
  - '"<i>Attention</i>!" Shouts the captain of Ludovico''s boat above the din of the
    crowd. "We''re getting ready to cast off. Those who are not on this vessel in
    three minutes will be left behind." He says with the finality of someone who has
    actually abandoned passengers before.'
  - You stay on the dock for a while, and watch his boat disappear into the distance.
    Part of you wants to watch him for as long as you can, and another part of you
    simply isn't ready for the trials of getting home through all of this chaos.
  - You wonder to yourself, is this something lost, or is this just another reason
    to make sure you survive?
  - '"This is it. <i>Addio</i>, Yvette."'
  - With a downcast gaze, he boards his boat.
  - True to his word, the captain casts off in three minutes, and soon it starts to
    leave Paris behind.
  - As the boat starts to leave, you're about to turn and head home, until you see
    Ludovico run to the back of the boat. He starts shouting, loud enough for everyone
    to hear.
  - '"Yvette! Please stay safe! You''re the best woman I''ve ever met!"'
  - '"You''re the greatest blessing I''ve ever had!"'
  - There's a hesitation in his voice, as he realizes that the entire dock is watching
    you both. He chooses his next words carefully.
  - '"I''ll pray for you, every day!"'
  - The dock is awash in murmurs as the assembled crowd tries to understand what they
    just bore witness to. Tensing up, waiting for the sudden backlash, you realize
    that the people around you think that you must be an extremely loyal and devout
    Christian, in order to get a priest to react this way.
  - (You have gained quite a bit of credibility)
  - True to his word, the captain casts off in three minutes. Just like that, it starts
    to leave Paris behind.
  - You pretend as if this moment will last forever.
  - You wonder if they have the right idea.
