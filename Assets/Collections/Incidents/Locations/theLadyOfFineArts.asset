  _nodeText:
  - "When you meet up with \xC9lisabeth, you walk together in silence for some time.
    However, you notice that she's walking closer to you than usual, and generally
    seems more upbeat."
  - '"About how I''ve tried to keep them at bay by feigning indifference."'
  - '"I think I''ve been going about this all wrong."'
  - '"Yes, actually."'
  - "\xC9lisabeth just laughs, astonished."
  - '"I tried to think that rebuking my detractors would only embolden them, but
    that dignity only works for lords and ladies. They have titles and privileges
    to protect them. I don''t."'
  - '"Why should I sit idly by while fools drag my name through the mud?"'
  - '"Well, I started talking to Marie again and I tried to apologize for embarrassing
    her with that portrait."'
  - "A few tears roll down her cheeks, but \xC9lisabeth doesn't seem to notice. \n\n\"All
    this time I thought I was a monster, but I'd never hurt my friend. In fact, I
    gave her exactly what she wanted.\""
  - "\xC9lisabeth favors you with a big, happy grin. \"I knew you'd like that.\""
  - '"That''s the problem. I kept telling myself that letting my detractors say anything
    they please about me was dignity."'
  - '"I started talking to Marie again, and she told me that my portrait was her
    favorite. That it was the best painting of her that anyone had ever done."'
  - '"No, it''s not that. I''ve just realized that all my time spent feigning indifference
    has been a mistake." She pauses to brush away an errant tear. "Indifference isn''t
    working. I need to start defending myself."'
  - "\"And why not? I have many clients, I'm essentially the personal painter of
    her Majesty the Queen, and I'm a full member of <i>L'Acad\xE9mie Royale de Peinture
    et de Sculpture</i>. I'm not even forty years old and I've accomplished more
    than most will in their entire lives.\" "
  - '"To be honest, I think that I was troubled for so long that I forget what being
    comfortable with myself actually felt like."'
  - '"These last few weeks, I''ve been getting better, and one question kept coming
    back to me."'
  - '"Realizing this, it''s made everything better. Even my paintings are coming
    easier than before. I''m actually excited about my next three patrons."'
  - '"... and well, you''ve been a big part of that."'
  - Looking deep into your eyes, she says. "You really have."
  - She smiles at you. "Please, take the compliment. You don't need to be so modest."
  - '"You''re free to think that, if you like, but I''ve already made up my mind."'
  - 'The conversation dies down for a minute, while you both recompose your thoughts. '
  - '"She reaches out and loops her arm through your own. The two of you walk, arm
    in arm for a while.'
  - '"Ever since we started talking again, Marie''s been asking my opinion on all
    sorts of things. She feels like the Crown doesn''t have many friends left in
    France, and doesn''t know who they should be reaching out to."'
  - '"Allies? Like who?"'
  - "\xC9lisabeth pauses to think about this for a while, tapping her finger against
    her chin. \"The Church? Really?\""
  - Elisabeth pauses to think about this for a while, tapping her finger against
    her chin. "The Military? Really?"
  - "\xC9lisabeth pauses to think about this for a while, tapping her finger against
    her chin. \"The Bourgeoisie? Really?\""
  - Elisabeth pauses to think about this for a while, tapping her finger against
    her chin.
  - '"Well, it would be easy to get Marie to understand their concerns. As an art
    dealer, my husband is more Bourgeoisie than anything else."'
  - '"Well, it''s hard to argue with that logic. When danger grows close, you generally
    want the people with guns on your side."'
  - '"Well, that makes sense. It''s good to stick with the people who''ve supported
    you in the past, and his Majesty has always been able to count on the Holy Father,
    the Pope."'
  - "As your mind twists and turns, trying to calculate the political consequences
    of that little suggestion, you realize that this isn't your normal route home.
    You must have been too lost in the conversation to notice. \n\nYou glance up
    and down the deserted and streets and wonder where you're actually going."
  - '"Whenever I''ve passed through here, this square tended to be empty around now."
    She explains, gesturing at the open courtyard.'
  - She flushes, and her voice gets quieter. "I also thought the moonlight was romantic."
  - Discretion.
  - '"I understand." She says with a smile, tinged with regret.'
  - Despite the risks, your lips meet hers and they are warm. They are soft. Her
    hand traces up your spine and it feels right. Your fingers entwine themselves
    in her hair.
  - The two of you sit close together, at the fountain's edge. You hold hands and
    watch the moon. She holds onto you with such a tightness, like a sailor thrown
    overboard, holding onto a rope, trying not to drown.
  - An older man staggers by, watching you with the glazed over, uncomprehending
    expression of a man who's drank beyond his limits. He makes no attempt to hide
    his staring, and in that moment, your need for discretion feels justified.
  - The sound of a throat clearing snaps you back to reality, and you can feel Elisabeth
    freeze like a statue in your arms.
  - The two of you spend some more time together by the fountain, making little jokes
    and tossing pebbles into the water. It's nice to be together, but eventually
    you have to part ways.
  - At home, Camille opens the door on the first knock. "<i>Bonsoir</i>, Madame!"
  - '"How was your evening?"'
  - '"I''m glad to hear that, madame!" Camille chirps, her cheeks flushing slightly.
    "I''ve prepared your room, just the way you like it."'
  - '"I don''t know what that means, but it sounds lovely!" Camille replies, full
    of enthusiasm. "I''ve prepared your room, just the way you like it."'
  - '"I''m sorry to hear that, madame." Camille replies glumly. "If it helps, I''ve
    prepared your room, just the way you like it."'
  - Burdened with heavy thoughts, you trudge upstairs, already planning what you'll
    write in your journal before bed.
  - With sweet thoughts of the evening's details dancing through your head, you go
    upstairs, already planning what you'll write in your journal before bed.
  - With triumphant thoughts of the evening's machinations marching through your
    head, you go upstairs, already planning what you'll write in your journal before
    bed.
  - She glances down at your hands. "Verbally, that is."
  - '"For the first time in a long time, I think I''m really alright."'
  - '"Lately, I''ve been considering some of the things you''ve said to me. About
    my critics, and how hard it is to ignore all of their remarks."'
  - '"If I''m to be happy, I must stop letting fools drag my name through the mud."'
  - After a long pause, she speaks again, her voice starting to crack "Do you know
    what Marie said to me?"
  - '"She told me that it was her favorite. That it was the best painting of her
    that anyone had ever done."'
  - "\"The art critics, and those boors in <i>L'Acad\xE9mie</i>, they're the ones
    who hurt her! I let them blame me, until I blamed myself.\""
  - '"It wasn''t. They wanted me to stop talking, so they could control the conversation.
    I''ve been giving them what they want."'
  - '"No more."'
  - Eventually, she looks at you with shock and disgust. "The Revolution? You want
    me to tell my friend to go soft on the people that want to hurt and disempower
    her family?"
  - '"Yvette, is that where your allegiance really lies?"'
  - '"That''s not what I expected, but it makes sense. If she encouraged the King
    to leave them alone, it could show that the Crown is willing to listen."'
  - The two of you walk together, in heavy silence. While you're sure it couldn't
    be longer than a few minutes, it feels like it stretches into eternity.
  - '"Actually, no. Don''t answer that."'
  - '"I hate that we always have to hide, when we''re together and well... I figured
    an empty courtyard might be the next best thing."'
  - "To him, and to the rest of the world, you and \xC9lisabeth are just two close
    friends. Anything closer would be worthy of disapproval, ridicule, even violence.
    So you hide your feelings, to make society more comfortable. To please the sensibilities
    of the drunk on the street. "
  - Discretion is for cowards.
  - "That word echoes in your mind as your hand brushes the side of \xC9lisabeth's
    face, tucking a stray lock over hair behind her ear, while she does the same
    to you. Like a taught thread, the need for discretion attempts to hold you back."
  - "After a while, it feels... normal. It feels like how any two people should feel,
    while in love. Alone together on a moonlit night. \n\nIt feels normal, and that
    fills you with a special kind of joy. "
  - You sit up straight, and stare right back at him. You stare as hard as you can,
    until, with a sneer, he departs. He spits on the sidewalk right before he turns
    a corner.
  - With a sigh, you look away, feigning deference until he feels satisfied and walks
    away with his minor triumph.
  - An older drunk, stares at you with a disapproving frown.
  - Silently, you part ways when you arrive near your home.
  - "(You have gained quite a bit of favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - (You have gained a decent amount of peril)
  - '(You have gained some credibility)

    (You have gained some peril)'
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - (The Revolution has gained quite a bit of power)
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - (You've lost a little favor with Elisabeth)
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - '"What do you think? She keeps asking me, but I''m just a painter!"'
  - (The Church has moved towards the Crown by quite a bit)
  - (The Military has moved towards the Crown by quite a bit)
  - (The Bourgoeisie has moved towards the Crown by quite a bit)
  - 'You know this place. This is the fountain square where you met when she was
    still searching for inspiration. This late at night, the square is practically
    abandoned. The sky is clear and the moon bathes everything in a pale glow. '
