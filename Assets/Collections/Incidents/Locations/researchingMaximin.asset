  - "You walk the streets near the marketplace <i>les Halles</i>, and just\u2026
    listen."
  - '"Porters, commoners, and servants bustle to and from. They haggle, exchange
    coin for wares and occasionally lean in, to slyly share the most interesting
    and scandalous news of the day. The marketplace buzzes with activity, like a
    beehive.'
  - "Far from the nobility, this feels like the right place to inquire about Maximin\u2019s
    mystery servant."
  - "Delving into the marketplace proper, you talk with the various merchants, trying
    to learn a little more. It\u2019s like fishing in a river for one particular
    fish. However, you walk away with one valuable piece of information.\r"
  - "You approach the man shouting newspaper articles to the nearby shoppers. Only
    a few people have stopped to actually listen to him. His clothes look like they\u2019re
    of fine make, but they\u2019re old enough to be in a state of disrepair. \r"
  - "All of the servants who suddenly left Maximin\u2019s employ were men\u2026 except
    for this one. The mystery servant is a young woman.\r\n\r\nNot only that, she's
    a woman with eyes that are different colors from each other. It\u2019s said to
    be quite striking to behold.\r"
  - "You\u2019ve never heard of anything like that before, but it\u2019s certainly
    possible. If nothing else, it would make this person quite distinct. However,
    there are over a million people in Paris. \r"
  - Knowing what they look like is simply not enough to track them down.
  - "Acting on a hunch, you check in with the crier you saw reading the newspaper
    aloud earlier. Only a few people have stopped to actually listen to him. His
    clothes look like they\x19're of fine make, but they'\x19re old enough to be
    in a state of disrepair. \r"
  - "\u201CThe Estates General approaches! Representatives from the third estate
    expected to demand changes to noble privileges!\u201D"
  - "\u201CJoseph-Michel Montgolfier designing new flying balloon!\u201D"
  - 'The crier pauses to glare at you for a moment, before tapping his hat full of
    coins with his foot. He then returns to reading the headlines aloud to the crowd. '
  - "\u201COh, <i>merci</i> madame!\u201D The Crier says to you, feigning the appropriate
    amount of surprise.\r\n\r\nHe folds up the newspaper and tucks it under one arm.\r"
  - "\u201CVenetian arsenal in Corfu explodes, over 100 believed dead!\u201D\r"
  - "The crier glares at your interruption with even greater intensity than before,
    and insistently taps his foot next to his hat full of coins on the ground.\r\n\r\nWith
    a deep breath, he continues proclaiming headlines.\r"
  - (You have spent 1 Livre)
  - "\u201CHow may I help you?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, that is quite the mystery...\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, that is quite the mystery...\u201D"
  - "\u201C1st United States Congress declares new constitution to be in effect!\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhat?\u201D He shouts at you, a vein bulging at the corner of his forehead."
  - "\u201CCan you not see that I\u2019m working?\u201D"
  - "\u201CFine! If it will make you go away, then fine\u2026\u201D He angrily wads
    the newspaper up and tucks it under his arm."
  - "\"Nobody\u2019s asked about the mystery servant rumor for a while.\" He pauses
    to think for a moment before continuing. \"I remember my cousin tried to claim
    that this servant had committed murder in cold blood, but that turned out to
    be a pack of lies\u2026\"\r"
  - "\u201CFine! If it will make you go away, then fine\u2026\u201D He angrily wads
    the newspaper up and tucks it under his arm."
  - "\u201CAh yes, I remember now! This servant is still in the city somewhere, working
    at a cafe. The good Baron threatened the owner to fire the servant, but the cafe
    owner wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201D"
  - "\u201COther than that, I am at a loss madame. Now, you must excuse me, as I
    must return to my work\u2026\u201D he unfolds the newspaper and returns to yelling
    to the crowd, and soliciting donations.\r"
  - "A mystery servant, who now works in a cafe. There must be over a hundred cafes
    in Paris, how are you supposed to find this servant?\r"
  - "While all of this knowledge is still fresh in your mind, you take out your journal
    and write down everything you\u2019ve learned."
  - "Deciding that you\u2019ll need a little more information before you can track
    this person down, you decide to ask around the marketplace."
  - "Maximin\u2019s mystery servant works at a cafe in Paris. They\u2019re a woman
    with eyes that are different colors from each other. It\u2019s a solid lead,
    but you still have a ways to go before you can use it to hurt Maximin.\r"
  - Done for the day, you return home, to plan your next move.
  - (You now have a vital clue for finding Maximin's weakness. However, you'll need
    to figure out where to search next, on your own.)
  - "A man stands on a corner, reading the latest current events aloud from a newspaper
    to any passers-by willing to listen. Sometimes, people throw a coin into the
    hat placed at his feet.\r"
