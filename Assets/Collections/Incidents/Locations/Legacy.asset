  _nodeText:
  - You draw your shawl a little closer as you're buffetted by another gust of wind.
    Checking the notes in your journal, you see that you're close to the graveyard
    where Alex wanted to meet you. However, you still have no idea what you're really
    here for.
  - You spot Alex before he sees you. He looks pensive.
  - You walk up to him with no hesitation, but he has still yet to notice you.
  - Hanging back, you watch him for a while. He paces back and forth in the street
    like a caged tiger, wearing an expression of deep concern.
  - With his powerful strides, he still looks ever the man of action, even when he's
    worried. You feel as if you understand him a little better.
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - He looks up at you and approaches. His face wearing the same stony expression
    of concern.
  - Seeing no other way to get his attention, you playfully tap him on the shoulder.
  - '"Ah, you''re here! I''m so glad you came." He admits, with no small amount of
    relief. '
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - '"I see you chose to observe me before deciding to engage. I can certainly respect
    that. I admit, I would have done the same in your position. My letter wasn''t
    as clear as it should have been."'
  - Taking a deep breath, he gestures to the cemetary gate nearby. "This... is where
    my father is buried."
  - '"I''ve never been here before."'
  - Together, you walk through the open gates. Off, in one corner, you see a family
    gathered together for a funeral. You keep your distance from them, and in return
    they pay you no mind.
  - '"Like so many little boys growing up, my father was my hero. A dashing rogue,
    a secret aristocrat hiding away with my mother in the distant mountains of a tropical
    paradise. He sacrificed so much, to give me everything."'
  - '"... but when I said he sold me to afford his passage to France, I wasn''t telling
    you the whole truth."'
  - '"I wasn''t an only child, and my mother never made it to this country."'
  - "His next words are difficult, a creaking wheeze. \n\n\"My father sold my three
    siblings, and my mother.\""
  - '"It''s nice being your father''s favorite, but sometimes..."'
  - '"That''s true, I suppose. I never asked him for any of this." He admits.'
  - '"Yes, I do feel that," he sighs. "I''m glad you understand."'
  - '"... because they''re thousands of miles away, where simple messages take months
    arrive."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - '"What am I saying?" He growls, to himself more than anyone else. "It''s not a
    feeling, it''s an objective fact."'
  - Seeing your confused expression, the anger leaves him, replaced only by melancholy.
    "The average lifespan of a working slave in <i>Saint Domingue</i>... is around
    ten years."
  - '"... and because this all hapened nearly a decade ago!"'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - '"I wouldn''t be here, with all of my advantages, if he hadn''t condemned them
    to that suffering."'
  - You arrive at a gravestone. It's carved from fine marble, but already marred with
    dirth and soot. It says 'Marquis Alexandre Antoine Davy de la Pailleterie'. A
    series of battles are listed under the name.
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - '"He served in the army as well. I joined up to make him proud, but when he died
    I realized that there was nobody left to be proud of me."'
  - '"I thought that I should honor his memory, but now I''m starting to think that''s
    wrong too."'
  - '"I''ve been trying to live up to a great legacy... that isn''t great at all."'
  - '"You''re absolutely right. I must fight for others. I must do the things he would
    have never thought to do."'
  - '"No." He replies flatly. "I cannot live selfishly. I cannot live, as he lived."'
  - '"I like that idea." He smiles thinly, eyes still fixed on the headstone. '
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - He leans back his head and shouts "I am Thomas-Alexandre Davy de la Pailleterie,
    true heir to the title of the Marquis de la Pailleterie!"
  - He sighs contentedly, as if letting down a great weight. "But none of that matters..."
  - '"Today, I am Thomas-Alexandre Dumas. I am a man who will help the downtrodden.
    One who will use his might, in service of right."'
  - He looks at you and grins. "And I am so fortunate, to have people with me, who
    could help me when I was lost."
  - He kneels down, and with a handkerchief, cleans the smudges of dirt from the headstone.
    "Farewell father. I shall not return."
  - '"Yvette, I think we should be on our way."'
  - You walk outside with him, and notice that the funeral party from before has also
    finished up. While they still look somber, you can tell that they're also ready
    to move forward with their lives.
  - '"Thank you again. I don''t think I could have done that by myself."'
  - He gives you a theatrical bow "I am in your debt."
  - '"I''m sorry, but you should be able to understand why I wasn''t comfortable putting
    some of this in a letter. This has not been easy."'
  - He laughs loudly. "Yvette, if that's nothing to you, I can't wait to see what
    you think a real favor for your friends is."
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - (You have lost some favor with Alex)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - 'You look to the horizon and realize that the sun is setting. You glimpse beautiful
    oranges and purples between the buildings of the Paris skyline. '
  - '"Another day in the place that''s been kinder to me than anywhere else in the
    world. It''s given me freedom, education, excitement..."'
  - He loops his arm around your waist.
  - '"...and love."'
  - As you crane your neck to bring your lips closer to his, you feel one of his arms
    sweep behind your knees and he lifts towards himself, almost like a dancer's dip.
  - You wraps your arms around him and he hugs you close. Tightly and fiercely.
  - 'Your lips meet. You fling your arms around his neck and he only holds you closer.
    Between throes of passion, your eyes open for but a moment, and you glimpse a
    single tear rolling down his cheek. '
  - (You have earned a lot of favor with Alex)
  - 'Love is, of course, bigger than its grand romatnic gestures. The two of you spend
    the next hour watching the sunset, laughing and joking with each other. He regales
    with stories of daring that grow more improbable with every new telling. '
  - His body is as still and powerful as a tree, but as you rest your head against
