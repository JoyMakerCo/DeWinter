  _nodeText:
  - Getting up a little earlier than usual, you walk to the southern reaches of Paris,
    so you can attend Ludovico's sermon. Much as he said, the neighborhood is poorer
    than most, and many of the houses are in even worse condition than your own.
    Which is saying something.
  - '"In fact, you may reach out to me whenever you like." He manages to cough while
    he hands you a piece of paper with his address on it.'
  - Stopping to greet the parishioners still exchanging pleasantries outside, you
    enter the church and make your way to an unoccupied chair, near the front.
  - You sit down just as mass is about to begin. While you were raised Catholic,
    you found yourself to be a touch less zealous than most. In fact, you realize
    that this is the first time you've even attended a church since arriving in Paris.
  - Still, as the service progresses, you find yourself participating as if you'd
    never stopped. You know when to stand up, when to sit down, when to sing, and
    when to be silent.
  - It's a beautiful building, meaning that it was built when this neighborhood was
    still prosperous.
  - Slinking by the parishioners still exchanging pleasantries outside, you enter
    the church and make your way to an unoccupied chair, far from everyone else.
  - 'It''s a good sermon, though he tends to stammer when he makes eye contact with
    you. '
  - '""<i>Benedicamus Domino</i>" Ludovico intones to the crowd, signaling the end
    of the service.'
  - While most get up to leave, getting ready to go about their work day, you stand
    as the last in line, behind some of the other parishioners to be blessed.
  - Someone behind you shushes your musings, but you ignore them. There's nothing
    wrong with enjoying yourself.
  - Someone behind you shushes your musings, but you ignore them. If they didn't
    like the truth then shouldn't have sat near you.
  - You sit down just as mass is about to begin. While you were raised Catholic,
    you found yourself to be far less zealous than most. This is the first time you've
    ever attended a church out of anything other than simple religious obligation.
  - Still, as the service progresses, you find yourself participating effortlessly.
    You know when to stand up, when to sit down, when to sing, and when to shut up.
  - '"You may kneel," He says, gesturing with his free hand to the floor in front
    of him.'
  - You lower yourself to one knee, and he draws the sign of the cross on your forehead.
    The cool water drips down your brow and the bridge of your nose.

  - Slowly, you lower yourself to one knee, and the young priest reaches out his
    hand. Right as Ludovico is about to anoint your forehead with the sign of the
    cross, you look up and kiss his thumb, lightly running your tongue along its
    underside.
  - Ludovico says nothing, but you can tell the gesture has had quite the effect
    on him.
  - Ludovico says nothing, but you glance up at him and can tell your words have
    touched him.
  - '"I''m glad to see you here, Madame Decaux," he says just loud enough for the
    lingering parishioners to hear. "I''ve heard that your circumstances have left
    you with quite the troubled soul."'
  - '"If you''d like, we could meet at a later time, for spiritual council."'
  - '"I''m prepared to go to any lengths you desire." He says, suddenly forgetful
    of the crowd around the two of you.'
  - '"I cannot force you to do anything you don''t want to do, Madame Decaux."'
  - '"I suppose we will." Ludovico manages to cough, trying to hide his flushing
    cheeks from the crowd.'
  - '"In fact, you may reach out to me whenever you like." He hands you a piece of
    paper with his address on it.'
  - '"However, you may reach out to me whenever you like." He says, handing you a
    piece of paper with his address on it.'
  - Outside the church, standing in the day's sun, you realize that you are absolutely
    exhausted. You decide to head home.
  - Walking home, you puzzle over the morning's events.
  - You take your time, during your stroll home. The weather is lovely, and everything
    feels brighter than usual. In fact, it feels like the start of something special.
  - You hurry home, feeling like the eyes of the entire neighborhood are upon you.
    While the actual walk home is safe, every shadow seems like it contains a new
    threat, ready to spring forth and be your undoing.
  - Thankfully, Ludovico's directions turn out to be correct and you find the church
    without any difficulty. Parishioners are still filtering inside, with a few loitering
    outside to chat and catch up on the news of the day.
  - At some point, a procession brings forth a reliquary containing the forearm bone
    of a martyred saint. You look at the people around you, and they seem so moved.
    Moved by the parts of a corpse of a man that died hundreds of years before they
    were even born.
  - Ludovico presides over everything from his lectern, speaking Latin as if it was
    his native tongue.

  - "At one point, a procession brings forth a reliquary containing the forearm bone
    of a martyred saint. You look at the people around you, and they seem transfixed
    by it. It's amazing to think that such a thing could still carry so much meaning
    for so many people. \n\nDid that saint ever imagine that this would happen? That
    they would affect so many, long after their death?"
  - '"<i>Deo gratias</i>," The crowd replies reflexively, yourself included.'
  - 'You finally reach the front of the line, and see Ludovico there, looking every
    part the humble priest, his thumb anointed with holy water.


    "Approach,
    Madame Decaux."'
  - While none of the other parishioners dare speak a word about it, you hear a collective
    intake of breath. Wind tensely whistling between their teeth.
  - It's all an absurd performance, for the sake of gossiping parishioners who will
    all carry your imagined circumstances far and wide. Yet, you can't help but appreciate
    the thought he's put into this.
  - "With a polite nod you take your leave before anyone becomes suspicious. \n\nWell,
    even more suspicious, really. "
  - (You may now go on rendezvous with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little peril)
  - The holy water slowly drips down your lips and across your chin.
  - (You have gained some favor with Ludovico)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Ludovico)

  - "You return home to find Th\xE9r\xE8se waiting for you outside. She looks up
    from her black book at your approach."
  - '"I imagine things went well?" She asks. "Now that you can meet with Father Sidotti
    in public, you should take advantage of that fact. He''s likely to speak more
    openly with you after a Rendezvous."'
  - '"Now, if you may excuse me, I have a contact to meet." She says with a brief
    curtsy before heading off into the city, leaving you with your thoughts.'
