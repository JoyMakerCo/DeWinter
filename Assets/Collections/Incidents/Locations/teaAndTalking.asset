  - You decide to spend the day in the square near the water fountain. It's so humid
    today that if you spent any more time inside then you were afraid that you'd
    suffocate. You have no idea how Camille is managing to keep working in the kitchen,
    with a fire going, but you're glad that she can do it.
  - Even sitting on the edge of the fountain, cooled by the light mist, you're sweating
    like a horse at full gallop, without the breeze to accompany it. You feel disgusting,
    and secretly dread the idea of someone seeing you like this.
  - "It's at that moment, that \xC9lisabeth appears at your side, holding a steaming
    cup of tea in each hand. \"Drink this, it will help with the heat.\" "
  - You oblige her, and are quickly surprised to find out that she's right. Something
    about it makes the heat more bearable. "I picked it up from the travelling vendor
    over there. We'll need to get him his cups back, eventually." She says, pointing
    out the man carrying the giant, awkward metal tank of tea on his back. The spigot
    for the tea is sculpted to look like a dragon's mouth.
  - '"... and before you say anything to the contrary, I don''t think you look disgusting,
    at all."'
  - Well, that's good to know.
  - "\"Yvette, is that you?\r\" Rings out a voice from the other side of a crowd."
  - Alex strides over to the two of you, having freshly dismounted from his horse
    and holding the reins in his hand. The crowd easily parts for both him and his
    animal.
  - Looking at the two of you Alex suddenly takes half a step backwards. "Ah, <i>mon
    Dieu</i>! How rude of me! Was I interrupting something?
  - "\"No, not at all!\" \xC9lisabeth replies. \"In fact, with you here, Yvette and
    I don't have to worry about strange men barging in to the conversation.\""
  - '"Oh, joy of joys." Elisabeth replies flatly. "An armed man walking into our
    conversation. I, in no way, feel threatened."'
  - '"Don''t worry! I''m on watch!" Alex laughs, stepping closer to the both of you,
    and scanning the crowd attentively.'
  - "The three of you spend some time catching up and telling stories, but you get
    the sense that \xC9lisabeth and Alex don't really know how to act around each
    other. There's not necessarily a tension between the two of them, but there is
    a wariness."
  - '"The dragoons are not a threat." Alex sighs. "The only reason we''ve even been
    stationed in Paris is for everyone''s protection."'
  - '"That''s exactly what people who are a threat say!" Elisabeth replies. "Who
    and what are you even protecting us from? Everyone know the military is just
    one step away from joining the revolution anyway."'
  - The two of them glare at each other angrily, occasionally glancing at you.
  - '"Yvette, would you care to join me for a little while on my patrol?"'
  - They stop to consider this. Alex shifts his feet, and glances back a few times
    at his horse.
  - "\"<i>Bonne chance</i>! Corporal Dumas!\" \xC9lisabeth exclaims in agreement,
    shifting a little closer to you."
  - '"<i>Fantastique</i>!" Alex says, helping you up from your seat on the edge of
    the fountain. "I doubt things will get too ''interesting'', but who knows?"'
  - '"Well, today has been rather slow." Alex admits, the tension seeming to drain
    out of him. "There can''t be too many ne''er do wells out in this blasted heat."'
  - '"Fine, I can wait a touch longer. What would you have us do, then?"'
  - "\"I-I can't do this.\" \xC9lisabeth sighs in exasperation. \"I finally felt
    comfortable being... No, this is just ruined. I need to go.\""
  - '"What would you have me believe, Madame Le Brun?"'
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - "\"To be completely honest, I rarely know what anyone actually wants from me,
    so I'm at a loss as to what I should do next.\" \xC9lisabeth sighs. \"Do you
    have any good stories, Alex?\""
  - "\xC9lisabeth starts talking, not really about the monarchy per se, but instead
    about what she personally knows about Marie-Antoinette. How Marie has been disliked
    by the French people from the very beginning, due to being a foreign born queen.
    She talks about Marie's desire to help people, including her multiple adopted
    children, amongst them the former slave Jean Amilcar. "
  - '"Pardon? What am I ruining?"'
  - "\"I've just been a fool. I have to go.\" \xC9lisabeth says to nobody in particular,
    starting to breathe faster and faster. You knew that expressing her affections
    in public was hard for her, but you didn't expect it to be this bad."
  - "\"God no!\" \xC9lisabeth laughs. \"I have enough toil and trouble in my life
    as is. I'll stick to mixing paints and all the cursing that comes with that instead.\""
  - '"I''ll have you know that your facial expressions are very easy to read when
    you think that nobody is watching."'
  - "\"It doesn't make any sense, does it?\" \xC9lisabeth admits. \"It's just an
    old trick that my mother taught me. I don't understand why it works, but it's
    yet to fail me.\""
  - "\"N-not that I watch you a lot.\" \xC9lisabeth suddenly turns away and blushes.
    \"It's just that examining people's faces is something I do for work. I'm an
    expert, of sorts...\""
  - '"Besides, I don''t think I''d look good in black."'
  - "\"<i>Merde!</i>\" Alex grunts and shakes his head. \"I lost track of time and
    need to resume my patrol.\" Out of the corner of your eye, you can't help but
    notice that \xC9lisabeth looks a little excited by the prospect of spending more
    time alone with you."
  - "(You have lost some favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(You have lost some credibility)"
  - '"The ''Chevalier de Saint-Georges'', as you know him, was my fencing instructor
    when I first came to France. Joseph is the most capable swordsman I''ve ever
    in all my life. I used to watch him toy with challengers by slicing buttons,
    one at a time, off of their coats."'
  - "\"So you understand, then!\" \xC9lisabeth exclaims. \"Marie is trying to push
    things forward, but every time she does, the scandal from the public pushes her
    back. \"Royalty is powerful, but it can't actually overrule the feelings of the
    people. The Revolutionaries promise so much change, but what happens when their
    high minded ideas reach a conservative public?\""
  - '"Well, this isn''t normally something I''m normally asked to speak about, so
    it might be worthless, but we might as well get it over quickly, no?"'
  - '"That''s something to certainly think about." Alex admits, rubbing his chin
    thoughtfully. "None of these things are ever simple."'
  - (The Military has moved towards the Crown by some)
  - Alex checks his pocket watch and his eyebrows jump in surprise. "Ah! Now I really
    must be on my way. However, I have no regrets, today has been both fantastic
    and enlightening."
  - With that, Alex leaps a top his horse, tips his hat to you both, and leaves.
  - You and Elisabeth chat for a while longer, but eventually you part ways with
    her, and head home.
  - Today feels like it was a good use of your time.
  - She leaves before you can say anything to calm her spirits. Instead, you are
    just left with Alex, who seems both confused and frustrated.
  - '"What am I ruining?"'
  - (You have lost some favor with Alex)
  - Without another word, Alex mounts his horse, and returns to his patrol.
  - That... that was awful.
  - '"I know the royal family is often painted as this aloof, uncaring thing, but
    Marie is so much more than that. She befriends and listens to people from every
    walk of life, and has even sponsored the works of the Chevalier de Saint-Georges."
    She says, referring to the accomplished black composer, who has so often been
    scorned by the general public.'
  - '"It''s all too easy for them to promise what they could do, when there''s no
    way for them to follow through on their words. What guarantee is there that all
    of their promises of liberty and universal brotherhood won''t be cast aside,
    once they become inconvenient? I certainly wouldn''t believe a single thing those
    men say about what they''ll do for women. Why should you be different?"'
  - '"... yes. Thank you." Alex replies, obviously not anticipating this turn of
    events.'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - With that, Alex mounts his horse and returns to his duties.
  - "You and Elisabeth spend more time together, talking over your tea. It's not
    that there's anything wrong with Alex, per se, but being alone with just \xC9lisabeth
    is different. Really, you've found that to be true of any situation where only
    women were in attendance. It's not to feel like you're struggling to be heard,
    because everyone already understands the same things."
  - "You spend your time together catching up, unwinding, and edging closer and closer
    to each other on the edge of the fountain. \xC9lisabeth is so blas\xE9 about
    so many things, but there's something extremely cute about how anything close
    to romantic affection in public makes her nervous. You never do anything more
    overt than brush your hand against hers, but it's fun to watch her heart race."
  - "However, right as you're both about to finish up and say your goodbyes, \xC9lisabeth
    takes your hand in both of hers and says \"This has been wonderful. Thank you,
    Yvette.\""
  - With that, she leaves.
  - Today feels like it was a good use of your time.
  - "\"<i>Au revoir</i>, I guess.\" Says \xC9lisabeth, picking up the empty tea cups.
    \"I'll just return these myself.\" "
  - "You follow Alex as he departs, and \xC9lisabeth stays behind."
  - You and Alex walk together in the streets. He strolls with one hand around your
    waist, and the bridle of his horse in the other. His horse seems indifferent
    to the whole situation. The horse seems indifferent about everything, really.
  - Alex is telling you a tale of the latest 'intrigue' of the men in his barracks.
    Specifically, this is the story of several dragoons all trying to court the sister
    of his comrade, Corporal d'Auvergne. It's a funny story, and it reminds you that
    it's nice to be with Alex, because while he's never rude, he also never treats
    you like you're fragile.
  - Far too many men back in your village treated you like you were made of spun
    glass, and that you would shatter at the first sight of something indelicate.
    While you're sure they intended this to be kind and endearing, it merely ended
    up being frustrating and boring.
  - Your walk has to stop for a moment because Alex has gotten to the part of the
    story where his entire barracks of fifty men devolved into an all-out brawl,
    when it was revealed that not two, or three, but seven different dragoons all
    had designs on this young woman's heart. Hearing him describe the chaos, the
    two of you are laughing so hard that you almost feel sick.
  - Wiping tears of good humor from your eyes, Alex realizes that he must finally
    part, and that the two of you must say your goodbyes, for now. "Wish me luck
    out there."
  - You do, and he leaps atop his horse to resume his patrol.
  - '"Why, in fact I do!"'
  - 'Without any further ado, Alex launches into a tale about the latest ''intrigue''
    of the men in his barracks. Specifically, this is the story of several dragoons
    all trying to court the sister of his comrade, Corporal d''Auvergne. '
  - Soon, you all have to pause to catch your breath, because Alex has gotten to
    the part of the story where his entire barracks of fifty men devolved into an
    all-out brawl when it was revealed that not two, or three, but seven different
    dragoons all had designs on the young woman's heart. Hearing him describe the
    chaos, the three of you are laughing so hard that you almost feel sick.
  - "Alex can barely finish the story because he's laughing too hard at his own jokes.
    This, in itself, proves to be so funny that neither you nor \xC9lisabeth can
    stop laughing either."
  - It is a complete mess.
  - "\"So this is what we're up to?\" \xC9lisabeth says, wiping a tear of laughter
    from her eye. \"Alright, I think I have something you'll all like.\""
  - "\xC9lisabeth begins telling the story of a private commision she received. It
    was a client who insisted on having their portrait painted with their prized
    dog. It was a decent idea, but it was made difficult by the fact that the dog
    would pee when it was agitated... and it was always agitated."
  - "\"\"Of course, I'm a professional, so I can't say anything about it.\" \xC9lisabeth
    says. \"\"Instead I have to sit there with a straight face and paint, pretending
    that nothing is happening, while this animal is just soaking anything it gets
    close to. This wasn't a one time occurrence, mind you. This happened in every,
    single, sitting!\""
  - The laughter flows freely between you, and good times are had by all.
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(You have gained some favor
    with Alex)"
  - "Eventually, you all have to part ways, and Alex returns to his patrol. You and
    \xC9lisabeth return your cups to the tea vendor, who merrily tips his hat to
    you both. For a brief moment, all is right with the world."
  - Alex can barely finish the story because he's laughing too hard at his own story.
    This, in itself, proves to be so funny that you can't stop laughing either.
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"

  - 
  - 
  - 
  - '"Not much, I''m just trying to make sure that two people I enjoy very much get
    along."'

  - '"How''d you know that hot tea would make me feel better?"'
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - 
  - '"If you two don''t try to get along, I will simply leave."'

    your duties.\""
