  _nodeText:
  - You spend the day aimlessly wandering the streets and trying to clear your head.
    You've had a lot to think about lately, and it's becoming hard to keep it all
    straight.
  - You feel a tension in your breast as you see yet another patrol of archers go
    by. You've not done anything particularly wrong today, but something about their
    presence puts you on edge, like you've committed a terrible crime, completely
    forgotten about it, and now stand on the brink of being discovered.
  - Like most citizens, your main interest in the archers is making sure that they
    ignore you. However, up ahead you see that someone else has chosen a different
    approach. Two uniformed and armed men stand over a battered fellow who's sitting
    on the ground between them.
  - "You perform a double-take as you examine the scene further. \n\nIsn't that Alex's
    friend, Corporal d'Auvergne? He was the young dragoon who was far too deep in
    his cups when you first met. He looks sober now, but he does not look happy by
    any means."
  - The man arguing with the archer is a young soldier. Juding by his uniform, he
    appears to be a member of the Queen's Royal Dragoons.
  - '"I said stand down!" The watchman growls, taking a single step towards his opponent.'
  - 'The thief in question is sitting on the ground between them. His clothes are
    rumpled and a strike to the face has split his lips open, but he looks rather
    resigned to his fate.


    At least, as long as two heavily armed men are standing
    directly over him.'
  - "\"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, I wouldn't even be out here if you blockheads could do your
    own jobs. Though it seems that the R\xE9veillon Riots have shown that simple
    patrols are too much to ask of men like you.\""
  - '"What did you say?"'
  - Their argument continues apace, and you're starting to see the problem. Soldiers
    and the city watch aren't part of the same organization, and there's no real
    guide as to who is supposed to be obeying who here. In a time of heightened security,
    this line gets even blurrier.
  - '"Since when do I have to listen to the likes of you?" The dragoon replies. "I
    found this man cutting purses, I apprehended him, and I shall deliver him to
    the prisons myself."'
  - The fact that a soldier performing an arrest makes the <i>Guet Royal</i> look
    incompetent is likely a factor here, as well.
  - You notice the men shift their feet, and their hands start to tighten about the
    grips of their weapons. This could get ugly.
  - They both break away from their argument to eye you, then examine each other.
  - '"Well, I''m glad someone here is seeing sense!" The archer exclaims, as the
    crowd starts to grumble in agreement with you.'
  - '"Exactly? Is that not the proper order of things?" The young dragoon asks aloud,
    and the crowd starts to grumble in agreement with him.'
  - '"I suppose that could be possible, if you were amenable to such an arrangement..."
    The dragoon ventures.'
  - '"Don''t tell us what to do!" They yell, almost in unison.'
  - (You have lost some peril)
  - The young soldier is taken aback for a moment, before his face takes on an impetuous
    frown. "Fine, I am sensible enough to understand when my efforts are unappreciated.
    Good day to you all."
  - (You have lost a little favor with members of the Military)
  - With that, the dragoon mounts his horse and storms off, fuming at this public
    display of disrespect.
  - '"Thank you again madame for your civic mindedness." The archer says to you with
    a tiny bow and a self-satisfied grin.'
  - He then marches away, dragging the hapless thief behind him. Standing alone in
    the street, you're left wondering what happens in a city where even those tasked
    with keeping order can't work together.
  - (You have gained a little favor with members of the Military)
  - With that, the dragoon triumphantly hitches the thief by the wrists to his horse,
    mounts up, and leaves. Even at a slow walk, the criminal desperately struggles
    to keep up with the horse towing him.
  - The watchman of the <i>Guet Royal</i> sneers at the crowd and starts commanding
    them to disperse, until he singles out you in particular.
  - '"You! We don''t tolerate agitators here. I''ll be keeping an eye on you."


    Even
    the departing crowd eyes you suspiciously, as if you were some sort of political
    plant, and not just someone walking by, like everyone else.'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - The archer storms off in a huff, and you're left wondering what happens in a
    city where even those tasked with keeping order can't work together.
  - '"As long as we can bring this villain to my station, I think we can work something
    out." The archer replies, casually kicking the thief on the ground to emphasize
    his point. The cut-purse yells in protest at this unnecessary abuse but nobody
    else seems to notice.'
  - '"Nothing could be more sensible! I''m glad you were willing to see reason!"'
  - 'Well, you were the one to help them see reason, but you decide to not let that
    get in the way of their mutual self-celebrations. '
  - They both give you a small bow of acknowledgement, so that's nice, at least.
  - '(You have gained a little favor with members of the Military)

    (You have
    lost some peril)'
  - 'The duo happily marches away together, dragging the hapless thief in tow towards
    judgement and some terrible fate after that.


    Probably branding. That seems
    to happen a lot.'
  - (You have lost a decent amount of credibility)
  - You however, are left in the street, wondering what happens in a city where even
    those tasked with keeping order can't work together.
  - Feeling things turn against you, you decide to leave the two of them to their
    fruitless argument. There's nothing else you can do.
  - As you wander home, you're left to wonder what happens in a city where even those
    tasked with keeping order can't work together.
