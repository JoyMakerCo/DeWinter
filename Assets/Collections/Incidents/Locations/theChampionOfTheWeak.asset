  - Getting ready for your day with Alex, you check your makeup in the mirror one
    last time. Flawless, as per usual.
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Revolution by quite a bit)
  - He turns to you with a mischievous grin. "Yvette, can you check my holster?"
  - With a light step you head downstairs and Camille opens the front door for you.
  - That's when you're greeted by something truly surprising.
  - Alex is already waiting for you outside, astride a brilliant white horse. Everything
    on his uniform is perfectly in place, and the leather polished to a mirror's
    shine.
  - '"Madame, you look far too beautiful to be walking the streets. May Joseph and
    I assist you?"'
  - '"I was hoping you''d say that." Alex says, as he adjusts himself further back
    in his saddle.'
  - He looks somewhat taken aback. "I'm not joking. I was hoping to offer you a ride
    tonight."
  - '"Yvette, don''t be ridiculous!"'
  - (You have earned some favor with Alex)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - '"I named him Joseph!" He laughs. "I haven''t heard any complaints from him yet,
    so I can only assume he likes it."'
  - 'Alex affectionately tousle''s his steed''s mane with a free hand. Joseph gives
    an appreciative neigh in response. '
  - (You have earned a little favor with Alex)
  - You place a hand on the back of the saddle and he grabs you by the middle of
    your forearm. On the count of three, you jump up, and he pulls you the rest of
    the way onto the horse. Thankfully, you already know how to ride sidesaddle,
    or this would be quite undignified.
  - '"You should hold on tight."'
  - '"Don''t worry, I''m one of the best riders in my unit. You''ll be fine." He
    replies, unenthusiastically.'
  - '"Well, I was just hoping you''d hold me close, but yes, I do like know you''re
    safe."'
  - '"Ah! Ever the woman of action! I love it."'
  - (You have earned a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have earned some favor with Alex)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - With a tug of the reins and an enthusiastic yell, Joseph rears up and you grab
    onto Alex instinctively. Together, you take off down the street at a good clip.
  - 'There''s something special about riding a horse. Being in a carriage, you inspire
    mystery, as you wind through the streets hidden from view. The public is left
    to wonder about your identity, your appearance, your intentions. '
  - However, on a horse, you're holding yourself up on a living pedestal for all
    the world to see. People stare, and children point. You inspire awe, by being
    so public.
  - It's enough to make you feel like a princess in a fairy tale. Hopefully, it's
    one of the nice fairy tales. Not the ones with all the torture.
  - You hold onto Alex's firm waist, thinking about everything that's happened.
  - Momentarily worried by the prospect of having to shoot someone, you flip open
    the leather flap on his saddle holster to reveal an unlabeled magnum of champagne,
    and two tin cups.
  - '"I was promoted this morning. You''re now riding with Sergeant Dumas of the
    Queen''s Royal Dragoons." He says, puffing out his chest.'
  - '"Nobody else in my unit knows about it yet, but I wanted to celebrate it with
    you first."'
  - '"Would you mind pouring me a glass?"'
  - '"Now, what should we toast to?" He mumbles to himself.'
  - '"How about... ''To his Majesty the King, long may he reign!''?"'
  - '"It appears that I''m at a loss. Any thoughts?"'
  - He a low voice he says "I'm thinking, to the Revolutionaries, France, and a constitution!"
  - '"Indeed, to the King! <i>Viva la Roi</i>!" He laughs as he merrily clinks his
    cup against your own.'
  - '"I certainly can''t say no to that." He laughs as he merrily clinks his cup
    against your own. "To us!"'
  - '"Indeed, to the Revolutionaries, France, and a constitution!" He laughs softly
    as he clinks his cup against your own.'
  - '"Really?" He asks with a note of surprise, before he merrily clinks his cup
    against your own. "Yes! To the people, and the nation that is rightfully theirs."'
  - '"I certainly can''t say no to that." He laughs as he merrily clinks his cup
    against your own. "To the Revolution and to us!"'
  - '"The Crown?" Alex asks, surprised.'
  - '"Really?" He asks with a note of surprise, before he merrily clinks his cup
    against your own. "Yes! To the Queen, the King, and all their descendants!"'
  - '"I certainly can''t say no to that." He laughs as he merrily clinks his cup
    against your own. "To his Majesty, and to us!"'
  - '"To the people?" Alex asks, surprised. '
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Crown by quite a bit)
  - You sip the champagne, to find that it's shockingly good. It must have cost a
    fortune.
  - '"Do you like our spoils of battle? I might have... appropriated the champagne
    from some fearsome brigands who had looted a winery a few months back."'
  - '"When we were first called to hunt the thieves down, the Count in charge of
    the winery was dreadfully inhospitable towards us." He says with such a carefree
    air that you can only assume that this nobleman was completely unbearable. '
  - '"I''m glad you agree! In the grand scheme of things, the Count didn''t lose
    much, and he received a simple lesson in how to treat those supposedly beneath
    him."'
  - '"I swore an oath to the King and Queen, not to wretches like that Count. If
    he cared so much about lost property, he should have been more polite to the
    people risking their lives to help him."'
  - He laughs "While I appreciate your good taste, there's no need to be greedy.
    The Count has learned his lesson, and we have fine champagne. Everyone is better
    off than they were!"
  - You uncork the champagne with a jolly pop and carefully pour yourselves two tin
    cups of fine drink. You pass his cup up to him, and he holds it aloft in one
    hand.
  - '"Yes, I think I''m alright." He says. "I can finally put it behind me, and think
    of the future."'
  - '"I was inspired by a feeling, Yvette. Today, I woke up feeling more like myself
    than any other day in my life.'
  - While you can see his face from your position, you can hear the frown in his
    voice. "Happy with what? Using my horse for personal business?"
  - '"I suppose they won''t, but my superiors already have their hands full with
    civil unrest and safeguarding their own careers, so I don''t think they''ll mind
    all that much."'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - '"Besides, my unit''s been stationed in Paris for far too long, and I think Joseph
    needed the exercise." He gives the horse an affectionate pat on the side of the
    neck.'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - As Joseph starts to slow down, you look around and realize that you've arrived
    at your destination, wherever it is.
  - Alex gets down off the horse first, and holds out his hand to you.
  - Without warning, you leap from the saddle into his arms.
  - You take his hand, and he gently helps you down from the horse. The gesture reminds
    you of a different time, a more chivalrous age.
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - Alex stops to tie Joseph to a hitching post, and then the two of you start to
    promenade beside the river, tin cups of fine champagne still in hand.
  - Alex manages to catch you, despite his face being frozen in a mask of shock.
    A passing crowd favors you with some whoops and cheers, and Alex replies with
    a theatrical wave.
  - '"I don''t know if this means that you truly trust me, or if you''re simply toying
    with me. Either way, I''m enjoying it."'
  - (You have gained a decent amount of favor with Alex)
  - He pauses, lost in thought for a moment before saying "Thank you for asking."
  - He reaches back and squeezes your hand. "Which is thanks to a certain someone
    I know."
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Crown by quite a bit)
  - '"You''re right!" He agrees, before merrily clinking his cup against your own.
    "To the people of France, and the happiness they deserve."'
  - '"Absolutely not. The Crown has given me success and freedom. I can never turn
    my back on that.<i> Viva la Roix</i>!" He grumbles as he weakly clinks his cup
    against your own.'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Revolution by quite a bit)
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Revolution by quite a bit)
  - '"That''s a great point, Yvette. To the Crown! <i>Viva la roi</i>!" He laughs
    as he merrily clinks his cup against your own.'
  - (The Military's allegiance has moved towards the Crown by quite a bit)
  - '"Absolutely not. The people and their needs have gone unheard for far too long
    in this country. To them!" He grumbles as he weakly clinks his cup against your
    own.'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - With a tug of the reins, Joseph takes off down the street at a reasonable clip.
  - '"After days of tracking these thieves down, the most incredible thing happened
    when we found the wine."'
  - '"All at once, the labels fell off, and we couldn''t remember who to return the
    wine to!"'
  - He grumbles to himself "<i>Mon Dieu</i>, I've met people that spent their whole
    lives scrounging in the dirt with better manners than that man."
  - Looking at the river banks, you can't help but notice just how many people are
    preparing to flee the city. People with money, at least. No matter what happens,
    the poorest people are usually forced to contend with the consequences, whatever
    they may be.
  - '"I don''t blame them." He says, gesturing to the people scurrying onto their
    boats. "Things are likely to get worse around here before they get better."'
  - '"Enough worry, though! I promised you a lovely day, and I intend to deliver
    on that promise!"'
  - You spend the day promenading up and down the river with Alex. You drink many
    toasts, to his latest accomplishments, and to your future together. Something
    about your open merriment proves infectious amidst the tension of the streets.
    People smile in your direction, or doff their caps as you two walk past, arm
    in arm.
  - "It's not a grand day, bedecked with finery, or stymied with pretension. However,
    it's a carefree and genuine one, that serves to lift your spirits in a way that
    nothing else would. \n\nIt makes you feel like everything is going to be alright."
  - (You have lost a little peril)
  - Perhaps, this is exactly what you needed.
