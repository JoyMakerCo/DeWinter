  - Wandering around town, you realize that you're near Cafe Principe, but you can't
    smell the familiar scent of roasting coffee beans. Which is a quite a shame,
    because the scent is absolutely heavenly.
  - "You are momentarily lost in a reverie imagining what life would be like if coffee
    tasted as good as it smelled. Would we ever drink anything else? \n\nIt would
    be a jittery world, indeed."
  - Behind you and to the right, you hear a commotion, you turn and spot a familiar
    face.
  - "\"Does anyone have a stove I can use? This is an emergency!\" It's Marguerite,
    from the cafe! She's holding a bunch of kettles and looks absolutely frantic.
    \n\nNobody is rushing to help, in fact they're trying to stay out of her way."
  - "She's happy to hear this until you start giving her directions. Her face falls
    and replies. \"<i>Non</i> madame, I'm sorry but that won't work. You live too
    far away. The water will be cold by the time I reach the caf\xE9. It has to be
    somewhere nearby!\""
  - Some members of the crowd turn to listen as you make an impassioned plea for
    this poor working woman beset by misfortune. She needs no money, no supplies,
    merely a stove with which to heat her water!
  - It's amazing how indecisive everyone in the crowd was, until money entered the
    equation.
  - "\"The stove in the caf\xE9 is broken and I have a lot of thirsty customers!\""
  - All the same, she smiles warmly to you "Thank you for trying. That's already
    more than anyone else here has done."
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - Hearing your impassioned plea, someone in the crowd hurriedly escorts you into
    a tavern where they work. Immediately, Margueritte sets up her kettles on a roaring
    stove.
  - Your impassioned plea falls on deaf ears, as people in the crowd simply shuffle
    by. Admittedly, it is an odd situation, but you still curse the strangers for
    their inaction. It doesn't take long for you to notice that some of the people
    nearby have even grown suspicious of you.
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - Perhaps there's something else that you can do...
  - Someone in the crowd hurriedly escorts you into a tavern where they work. Immediately,
    Margueritte sets up her kettles on a roaring stove.
  - You're not exactly sure how you get caught up in everything, but you're soon
    helping Marguerite ferry kettles of boiling water back and forth from the cafe
    for a few hours. It's exhausting, but you're met with a cheer from the patrons
    every time the two of you burst in the door with a new pair of kettles.
  - Someone jokingly calls you two 'The Angels of Steam'. The nickname sticks, at
    least for the day.
  - (You have gained a decent amount of credibility)
  - "The caf\xE9 waitress shrugs. \"Don't worry madame, I'll think of something.\"
    \n\nHer eyes don't portray the same optimism as her words."
  - '"Thanks again for your help." Marguerite says to you for the umpteenth time
    as she passes you during one of your deliveries.'
  - Eventually, the day winds down and you head home. You're tired, but glad that
    things managed to work out.
  - (You have spent 10 Livres)
  - Out of options, you part ways and head home. Things didn't work out today, but
    perhaps they'll go more smoothly tomorrow.
