  _nodeText:
  - You spend the day walking through the city, exploring the neighborhood near a
    marketplace. The air is pungent, a rush of scents from crisp vegetables, to fresh
    fruit, to less-than-fresh fish.
  - You ears suddenly perk up at the sound of a familiar voice, and you start slipping
    through the crowd in its direction.
  - You stumble upon Camille, her arms full with a basket full of the day's gorceries.
    However, she's been stopped by a watchmen of the <i>Guet Royal</i>, one of the
    infamous 'archers'. He's berating Camille in the middle of the street.
  - '"Where''d you get those?" He demands, gesturing to all of her groceries.'
  - '"<i>Quoi</i>? But monsieur, you saw me buy these. I got them over there." She
    says, pointing in the direction of a market stall.'
  - '"I saw no such thing!" He says, blistering at the suggestion that he could have
    been paying attention to his surroundings. "Where''s your receipt?"'
  - 'Camille''s eyes dart from side to side, and she turns her feet away from him.
    Something about this line of questioning is making her very uncomfortable. "I...
    uh... I never get receipts, monsieur." '
  - '"What? That''s ridiculous! Why not?"'
  - '"Well... I don''t... I can''t..." Camille starts and stops, looking ashamedly
    at the ground.'
  - '"You''re going to have to give me a very good reason not to haul you away." He
    growls, and one of his hands extends out, low, with his palm up.'
  - Ah... so that's what this is about.
  - Stepping between the watchman and Camille, you stealthily slip a few coins into
    his outstretched hand. He glances down, and immediately, his mood changes for
    the better.
  - 'Raising yourself to your full height, you step between Camille and the watchman.
    You feel a slight tug as Camille starts holding onto the back of your skirts. '
  - The watchman stares at you, absolutely startled, as you suddenly interpose yourself
    between him and Camille. "What? You've been robbed?"
  - '"Which way did he go? We don''t allow criminals here! Not on my watch!"'
  - He sighs, somehow angrier than ever. "Do you really think you're the first person
    to try such a ruse on me?"
  - '"Ah, I''m so glad to be of help." He says with an enormous grin as he tips his
    hat to you. "Now, if you fine ladies may excuse me, I need to find more citizens
    in need of public service."'
  - With that, he shuffles off into the crowd, leaving you and Camille alone.
  - (You have paid 5 Livres)
  - '"Wow madame, that was amazing!" She gushes. "Normally, I remember to bribe the
    authorities, but something came over me and I completely forgot."'
  - (You have gained some credibility)
  - You spend the rest of the day escorting Camille about on her daily errands. It
    takes a few minutes for her to completely feel comfortable again, but it comes
    eventually.
  - '"I''m not harassing anyone." He spits at you. "I''m merely keeping an eye out
    for known criminals."'
  - '"I''m not a known criminal! I shop here every week!" Camille yells out, over
    your shoulder. The watchman''s eye twitches in anger.'
  - Noticing that the crowd is finally starting to pay attention, the watchman simply
    glares at you. "Fine, I shall trust you for now. However, I swear that I'll be
    keeping an eye on you two."
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - Suppressing the powerful reflex to comment on the irony of that statement, you
    point him in a random direction. To sell the illusion, you provide a believable,
    yet suitably vague description of your imaginary assailant.
  - He pinches the bridge of his nose, trying to stifle an impending headache. "Look,
    I am going to let this drop, but I swear that I'll be keeping an eye on you two."
  - Musket at the ready, the watchman runs off into the crowd, yelling after an imaginary
    cutpurse. The moment you lose sight of him, the two of you start hurrying away.
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - With that, he stomps away into the crowd, leaving you and Camille alone.
  - '"Well madame, at least we didn''t get arrested." She says with a shrug.'
