        all around it. A few finished canvases still remain on the walls, though it
        looks like a lot of the others were either seized or destroyed.

  _nodeText:
  - Tugging on the edges of your hood to make sure your face is hidden from view,
    you glance down again at the hastily scribbled address Pierre gave you in his
    office. In addition to your regular traveling clothes, you have a small bag hanging
    off of your shoulder, and a portable lantern with a flint.
  - The front of the building is the painting studio, the floors spattered with pigments,
    and still littered with the scraps of various art supplies. An ornate desk sits
    in the front of the room, near the door, with papers scattered all around it.
    A few finished canvases still remain on the walls, though it looks like a lot
    of the others were either seized or destroyed.
  - You waited for sunset before you headed out, as it feels like these sort of things
    are better done under the cover of darkness. However, everything still feels too
    bright. Every hanging lantern, every candle-lit window, feels like an eye staring
    down at you.
  - "Winding your way through the streets of the seventh <i>arrondissement</i>, you
    can\u2019t help but think about how out of the way this place would have been
    for Armand. Yet, Pierre said that he was still a regular visitor. Despite yourself,
    you find your heart beating faster and faster as you get closer to the abandoned
    studio."
  - "Rounding a corner, you find yourself on an empty street, looking across the road
    at the studio. The windows of the small, two storey building have been boarded
    up, and there\u2019s a charred hole in the roof. A sign nailed to the door reads
    \u2018Closed! On orders of the King.\u2019"
  - "Rounding a corner, you find yourself on an empty street, looking across the road
    at the studio. The windows of the small, two storey building have been boarded
    up, and there\u2019s a charred hole in the roof. A sign nailed to the door reads
    \u2018Closed! On orders of the King.\u2019"
  - Before you can step any further towards the closed building, Hansel steps in front
    of you.
  - "Glancing around, you don\u2019t see anyone at all, as if the King\u2019s notice
    somehow closed the entire street. "
  - Rather than stand around in the middle of a dark street, you hike up your skirts
    and hurry across the road to the studio.
  - "You immediately notice that the door\u2019s been nailed shut."
  - "Putting down your unlit lantern, you start checking the boards on the windows,
    seeing if any of them are loose. On the third window, you find one set of boards
    easily gives way, like it\u2019s been pulled out before.\n\nSomeone else has been
    here."
  - "Leaning back and craning your neck to examine the roof, you see there\u2019s
    a hole big enough for you to enter the building through, but you don\u2019t have
    a ladder, or any way to get up there. For a moment you consider trying to enter
    the building next door, so you can drop down onto the roof, but it\u2019s better
    to do this as quickly as possible."
  - "Gingerly, you take down each of the boards, leaving them in a neat pile by the
    window to be put back later. Secrets are easier to uncover when nobody knows that
    you\u2019re looking at all."
  - "You carefully ease yourself through the window, making sure none of your clothes
    get caught on any exposed nails. Once inside, you close your eyes for a few moments,
    so they\u2019ll adjust to the darkness faster."
  - "Inside, the studio is even darker than you would have guessed. Between the boards
    on the windows, and the lack of lighting in the surrounding street, it\u2019s
    nearly impossible to pick out any detail smaller than the walls and doors.\n\nYou
    carefully use a flint stowed in the base of your lantern to light it, then muffle
    most of the light with the hem of your cloak. "
  - "\u201CMadame, I\u2019d like to inspect the building first. You never know who\u2019s
    taken up residence in empty places like this.\u201D "
  - Crouching as low as his sizeable frame will allow, Hansel advances towards the
    building with his hand firmly on the grip of his sabre. He glances inside the
    windows and tries the door, which appears to be have been nailed shut.
  - Eventually, he finds that some of the boards covering one of the windows are loose,
    quietly pries them off, and easily hops through the window into the building inside.
    You catch glimpses of him through some of the other windows as he scouts out the
    darkened interior.
  - "Hansel gazes warily at the building before turning back to you. For a moment
    he looks like he\u2019s about to object, but your mind is obviously made up. \n\n\u201CUnderstood,
    madame. We go together.\u201D"
  - After what feels like an eternity, you see his hand emerge from the opened window
    and motion for you to approach. You hike up your skirts and quietly hurry across
    the street towards him.
  - "When you get to the window, Hansel\u2019s hands emerge from the darkness and
    grab you by the waist, easily helping you into the building."
  - The mercenary crouches down and places his hand on the grip of his sabre. You
    hike up your skirts, and get ready to follow him. On his signal, you quietly dash
    across the street together, watching for any movement in the windows as your approach.
  - "Now that you\u2019re closer, you can see that the door has been nailed shut.
    Wordlessly, you and Hansel start checking the boards on the windows, seeing if
    any of them are loose. On the third window, you find one of boards easily gives
    way, like it\u2019s been pulled out before.\n\nSomeone else has been here."
  - "You get Hansel\u2019s attention, and he quietly takes down the boards, leaving
    them in a neat pile by the window to be put back later."
  - 'He enters the building first, his face frozen in a grim expression that almost
    makes you feel bad for any dangerous persons you might encounter.


    Almost.'
  - From your position outside, you peer into the gloom and watch Hansel examine the
    room for a few moments before he gives a satisfied nod, dropping his hand from
    his weapon. Returning to the window, he grabs you by the waist, and easily helps
    you into the building.
  - "Now that you have a little more light, you can see that most of the furniture
    inside is broken, and enough things are missing to make you wonder how much the
    Guet Royal seized during their raid. It\u2019s also only a matter of time before
    someone spots you and comes to investigate."
  - Your time is limited, where do you plan on searching for clues?
  - "The entrance to the back room isn\u2019t obvious and if Pierre hadn\u2019t told
    you about it earlier, you might have mistaken it for a closet door. When you go
    to open the door, you notice that the latch has been torn off. Probably a casualty
    of the raid."
  - The stairs creak underneath your feet as you make your way to the second floor.
    The long table and scattered cutlery suggests that it was used as a dining area.
    A small fireplace occupies one side of the room, with a wide swath of ash spilling
    out of the fireplace and onto the floor. Above the fireplace itself, a painting
    hangs on the mantle.
  - "Inside, the studio is even darker than you would have guessed. Between the boards
    on the windows, and the lack of lighting in the surrounding street, it\u2019s
    nearly impossible to pick out any detail smaller than the walls and doors.\n\nYou
    carefully use a flint stowed in the base of your lantern to light it, then muffle
    most of the light with the hem of your cloak. "
  - Now that you have a little more light, you can see that most of the furniture
    inside is broken, and enough things are missing to make you wonder how much the
    Guet Royal seized during their raid.
  - "Hansel steps in front of you and whispers. \u201CNow that we have a light in
    here, it\u2019s only a matter of time before someone spots us. I recommend we
    move quickly, madame.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWhere should we look?\u201D"
  - "Scanning the painting studio, you try to determine what you\u2019ll investigate."
  - The desk by the door is so beautiful that it seems to clash with the rough practicality
    of the other furniture in the room. All of the drawers have been flung open, and
    papers have been scattered everywhere.
  - "The paintings on the wall are all traditional historical pieces, exactly the
    sort of thing <i>L\u2019Academie</i> exalts as \u2018true art\u2019. Judging by
    the stern faces and repeated images, you\u2019re sure that the paintings are all
    meant to be some kind of political allegory, but you can\u2019t really tell what
    of."
  - Inside, the back room is cramped, mostly occupied by a circular table with some
    small chairs. Various notes are pinned to the wall, and as you shine your lantern
    about, you notice a slight glimmer under the table.
  - What are you going to investigate in the back room?
  - You scan the second floor, deciding what to investigate.
  - You rummage through the papers, but it seems like everything useful has already
    been taken.
  - "Looking at the paintings, you feel like you\u2019ve learned something about the
    artists here, but nothing useful about Armand. You\u2019ll have to search somewhere
    he would have spent a lot of time in. "
  - "You feel like you\u2019ve learned everything you can from the paintings in this
    room."
  - You lean close to the notes on the wall, and squint to read them. None of them
    make any sense, as if they were written in another language, or some kind of code.
  - You bend down to investigate under the table, trying to find what caught the light
    of your lantern and glimmered at you from the dark.
  - "You find a small scattering of coins. It appears that, at some point in the chaos,
    someone must have dropped their coin purse, and nobody noticed it. It doesn\u2019t
    bring you closer to Armand, but you\u2019ll never turn down free coin."
  - "No. Wait. It\u2019s just terrible handwriting."
  - "You bend down carefully, making sure you don\u2019t kneel in the large swath
    of ashes in front of the fireplace. A cold breeze blows at your back and you look
    up at the charred hole in the roof of the building. This fire must have gotten
    large enough to set a portion of the ceiling ablaze. It\u2019s a miracle this
    building is still standing at all.\n\nWhoever started this fire didn\u2019t have
    time to do things properly, they just needed something burned."
  - "Stepping over the ash in front of the fireplace, you gingerly take the painting
    off of its hook and examine it closely. It\u2019s not as carefully detailed as
    some of the others in the building, but there\u2019s a certain joyful energy to
    it. Whoever painted this genuinely enjoyed making it."
  - Eventually, you can deduce a meaning from the scratchings. All the notes are suggested
    readings, various books and pamphlets. They seem to cover a broad range of texts
    related to history and political theory. While some of the authors are French,
    you notice that most of them are from elsewhere in the continent, especially in
    central Europe.
  - "While you\u2019re sure this reading list is insightful, it won\u2019t bring you
    closer to finding Armand."
  - You find nothing else of value under the circular table.
  - "You pick through the ashes, finding fragments of leather and scraps of unburned
    paper. The writing on the paper is handwritten, not printed. It looks like a list
    of names. A membership list?\n\nThat\u2019s when you spot it."
  - "\u2018-and de Marbo\u2019, written in familiar handwriting on a fragment of paper.
    Armand was here, perhaps in this very room. Maybe there\u2019s something else
    connected to him nearby. "
  - The rest of the unburned scraps look too small or unclear to provide you with
    any additional information.
  - "It\u2019s a dining scene, done in a reflected perspective intended to make the
    actual room feel larger than it really is. All the men and women in the picture
    are laughing, clinking glasses and looking merry. \n\nEven Armand."
  - "Armand\u2019s smiling face is looking back at you from the picture, a glass raised
    in mid toast, and a quill in his free hand. On one side of him is a man you remember
    from your last night together with Armand. The man is named Isaac. On the other
    side of him, is a young woman, with strawberry blonde hair, who you\u2019ve never
    seen before. Her hand is on his shoulder. "
  - You turn the painting back and forth looking for more details, until you hear
    something metallic shift. Flipping the painting over, you find a note tucked into
    the frame on the back of painting, along with a key.
  - "You can\u2019t help but grin with satisfaction. This is the lead you were looking
    for."
  - Quickly and quietly, you skulk to the window you entered the building through.
    Peering through the window, it seems like the coast is clear for now. You lever
    yourself out the window, and into the street.
  - "\u201C<i>Ja</i>, madame.\u201D Hansel grunts as you give the signal to leave,
    leading you to the window you entered the building through. He effortlessly helps
    you out the window before following you out, scanning the street for witnesses."
  - "Outside, you fastidiously put the boards back where you found them on the window.
    Your ears perk up at the sound of approaching footsteps, and you spot the reflection
    of lantern light off of nearby buildings. The <i>Guet Royal</i> are on there way,
    but as long as you keep moving, you should be gone before they arrive. \r"
  - "Without even a look back, you disappear into the dark alley you initially approached
    the studio from.\r"
  - With a precious lead in your possession, and the authorities none the wiser, you
    vanish into the night.
  - Outside, he puts the boards back on the window where he found them. You can hear
    approaching footsteps, and spot the reflection of lantern light off of nearby
    buildings. The <i>Guet Royal</i> are on there way, but as long as you keep moving,
    you should be gone before they arrive.
  - "\u201CAfter you, madame.\u201D Hansel gestures towards the dark alley you initially
    approached the studio from."
  - With a precious lead in your possession, your bodyguard at your back, and the
    authorities none the wiser, you disappear into the night.
  - This particular investigation has cost you some precious time.
  - (You have gained 6 Livres)

  - (You have gained some peril)
  - Having learned everything you can from the painting studio, you decide to search
    elsewhere.
  - Having learned everything you can from the back room, you decide to search elsewhere.
  - "Your ears perk up at the sound of voices. They\u2019re distant, but it feels
    like they\u2019re headed in this direction. Glancing out a window, you see the
    flicker of lantern light on nearby buildings.\r"
  - "Someone must have spotted you and summoned the <i>Guet Royal</i>. If they find
    you here, they will most certainly arrest you.\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Gottverdammt</i>! The Guet Royal are on their way. Someone must have
    spotted us and summoned them.\u201D Hansel growls, scanning the various avenues
    of approach.\r"
  - "You don\u2019t have much time before they arrive, a few minutes at most."
  - "\u201CWe don\u2019t have long before they arrive. What should we do, madame?\u201D"
  - "\u201CStall them, Madame?\u201D Hansel asks with a cocked eyebrow. \u201CHmmm\u2026
    I think I have something that should do the trick.\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Ja</i>, madame.\u201D Hansel grunts with a sound of frustration that
    echoes your own. He leads you to the window you entered the building through.
    He effortlessly helps you out the window before following you out, scanning the
    street for witnesses.\r"
  - "Quickly and quietly, you skulk to the window you entered the building through.
    Peering through the window, it seems like the coast is clear for now. You lever
    yourself out the window, and into the street.\r"
  - With that, Hansel pulls out a flask of brandy from his coat and pours it all over
    himself. He then rumples his coat, doing up a few of the buttons into the wrong
    holes, and rumples his hair until he looks truly disheveled.
  - "\u201CThis should buy you some time, madame.\u201D"
  - "Hansel exits through the window you both entered from and jogs up the street
    towards the approaching authorities, you can already hear him shouting at them,
    slurring his words like a drunk.\r"
  - "\u201CMonsieurs, <i>Gott sei dank</i>! Someone has stolen my house!\u201D"
  - "While you don\u2019t have time to listen to Hansel\u2019s entire ploy, you\u2019re
    sure that he\u2019ll manage to waste everyone\u2019s time enough with wild stories
    for you to find what you\u2019re looking for."
  - (You have lost quite a bit of peril)
  - "Outside, he puts the boards back on the window where he found them. You can hear
    approaching footsteps, and spot the reflection of lantern light off of nearby
    buildings. The Guet Royal are on there way, but as long as you keep moving, you
    should be gone before they arrive. \r"
  - "\u201CAfter you, madame.\u201D Hansel gestures towards the dark alley you initially
    approached the studio from."
  - "While the authorities may be none the wiser of your deeds, you curse the circumstances
    that led you to this dead end. With your bodyguard at your back, you disappear
    into the night.\r"
  - "Outside, you fastidiously put the boards back where you found them on the window.
    Your ears perk up at the sound of approaching footsteps, and you spot the reflection
    of lantern light off of nearby buildings. The Guet Royal are on their way, but
    as long as you keep moving, you should be gone before they arrive. \r"
  - Without even a look back, you disappear into the dark alley you initially approached
    the studio from.
  - "The pounding of boots is getting louder and louder.\r\n\r\nThe <i>Guet Royal</i>
    are here.\r"
  - "With a crash and the sound of splintering wood, you can hear the door being kicked
    open.\r\n\r\n\u201CHalt, in the name of the king!\u201D someone shouts into the
    building.\r"
  - "\u201CYou! Put your hands in the air! What are you doing here?\u201D"
  - "\u201CLost, eh? That\u2019s a good story.\u201D He says, his voice even, but
    stern. "
  - "\u201CYour\u2026 fiance?\u201D He asks, incredulous for a moment. \u201CYou\u2019re
    looking for your fiance, in the middle of the night, in a building ordered closed
    by the king?\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CDo you have any earthly idea how many times I\u2019ve heard that?\u201D
    He asks, his face switching to an expression of tired disapproval. \r"
  - "\u201CIn fact, it\u2019s so good, that you can tell everyone down at the watch
    post all about it\u2026\u201D"
  - "He sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. \u201C<i>Non</i>, I don\u2019t have
    the time for this. Come with me, we\u2019re going to the watch post, and you\u2019re
    going to explain this to someone who cares.\u201D "
  - "\u201CCome with me, we\u2019re going to the watch post, and you\u2019ll have
    plenty of time to come up with a better excuse as to why we found you in building
    ordered closed by the King.\u201D"
  - "You don'\x19t recognize the handwriting, but decide against taking the time to
    read the note now, while illegally trespassing in a condemned building. You carefully
    fold the note around the key and secret it under your stays.\n\nYou'll be able
    to investigate it later."
