  - Travelling about town you find yourself, once more, in a fountain square. You're
    not sure if you've been to this particular one before, but something feels distantly
    familiar.
  - As you grow less distant, you realize exactly what's familiar. It's a certain
    overpowering cologne. There's only one man in Paris who's snorted so much snuff
    as to think such a vile concoction was a good idea. In fact, someone is screaming
    at him, right now!
  - '"How dare you? You salacious cur! You''ve aired my private matters for all the
    world to see and I''ve been nearly ruined!"'
  - Pierre laughs nervously. "Monsieur, I'm afraid you're going to have to be a little
    more specific as to your identity..."
  - The man grabs Pierre by the shirt collar and drags the diminutive journalist
    closer. "How about I knock some sense into you? Will you remember, then?"
  - Now, this is a problem. If Pierre gets thrashed to death, there'll be nobody
    left to buy your gossip!
  - '"What?" The man says, noticing you for the first time. "This scoundrel has wronged
    you as well?"'
  - The man looks at you, aghast. "Madame, are you absolutely serious?"
  - Roughly pushing Pierre aside, Hansel steps close and looms over the enraged stranger.
    "Anything you do to that man, I will do to you, only with far less niceties."
  - He sneers at you. "Honestly, I just can't believe there's anyone left in Paris
    who would willingly defend this man."
  - Pierre shrugs and grins. "If it's any consolation, this is all a surprise to
    me as well."
  - Take aback by this situation, and the fire of his ire dying, the enraged man
    starts to walk away. "He's all yours."
  - Suddenly, he turns on his heel and swiftly punches Pierre in the gut. The journalist
    doubles over in pain.
  - '"Hurf... the indignities we suffer for exposing the truth, <i>non</i>?" Pierre
    asks through a forced smile. "I''m sure I would be in far worse condition, had
    you not intervened."'
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - The assailant glares at you. "If you're associated with this wretch, I would
    advise that you watch yourself."
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - He shuffles through his pockets and hands you a few coins as a 'bonus' for your
    help.
  - (You have gained 7 Livres)
  - You help Pierre back to his office, which is also where he lives...
  - Once you're certain that he's not going to die of his injuries, you head back
    to your own place. It's a rough world out there.
  - '"Well, I am a gentleman, and I will let you have your satisfaction." He says,
    starting to walk away.'
  - '"<i>Non, non</i>..." The man replies, shaking his head in disbelief. "This scum
    looks far too happy to see you. You''re one of his compatriots aren''t you?"'
  - Suddenly, he turns on his heel and swiftly punches Pierre in the gut. The journalist
    doubles over in pain.
  - '"... now that I''ve acquired my own satisfaction" He gestures generously to
    Pierre, who is bent double in the road. "He''s all yours, madame."'
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - The assailant walks away, disappearing into the crowd.
  - Pierre's smile quickly melts away, as does your ruse.
  - Absolutely beside himself, the man growls. "I have half the right mind to thrash
    the both of you, but I will be merciful for now. "
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - The fire of his ire dying, the enraged man starts to walk away. "He's all yours."
  - Suddenly, he turns on his heel and swiftly punches Pierre in the gut. The journalist
    doubles over in pain.
  - The assailant glares at you before he departs. "If you're associated with this
    wretch, I would advise that you watch yourself."
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - '"Hurf... that could have gone better, <i>non</i>?" Pierre asks through a forced
    smile. "I''m sure I would be in far worse condition, had you not intervened."'
  - The man leans around Hansel to yell at you indignantly. "Are you serious? You're
    really going to rush to the defense of this vermin, of all people?"
  - Pierre laughs from his position, cowering behind you. "Don't worry monsieur!
    It's a surprise to me as well!"
  - With a string of curses, the enraged man storms off, unsatisfied. Hansel steps
    back, his duties complete.
  - '"The dangers we risk for exposing the truth, <i>non</i>?" Pierre asks with a
    massive smile, dusting off his worn coat. "I''m sure he would have torn me to
    ribbons, had you not intervened."'
  - He shuffles through his pockets, and hands you a handful of coins as a 'bonus'
    for your help.
  - (You have gained 15 Livres)
  - You escort Pierre back to his office, mostly to make sure the journalist's new
    enemy doesn't try to finish the job he started.
  - Once you're certain he's not going to be ambushed, you head back to your own
    home, with Hansel in tow. It's a rough world out there, but that's exactly why
    you hired a bodyguard.

  - '"Step away from Pierre, or there will be hell to pay!"'
  - '"Hansel, I need Pierre in one piece. Handle this."'
