  - "You start hurrying over to \xC9lisabeth's house. If someone actually tried to
    poison her, then this can't possibly wait."
  - "The sound of Th\xE9r\xE8se's leather boots loudly clacking on the cobblestones
    behind you serve as a reminder that she's managing to keep pace with you. You're
    not sure what you spy-mistress can do for you right now, but this sort of thing
    feels like her domain."
  - "It doesn't take long to reach \xC9lisabeth's house. Thankfully, you've already
    been here before, so the route is fresh in your mind."
  - "It doesn't take long to reach \xC9lisabeth's house, given your quickened pace."
  - "Knowing \xC9lisabeth's preferences about discretion, you try to just walk inside,
    but it's actually locked. Not knowing what else to do, you knock but, there's
    no immediate answer. All you hear is a panicked yelp, and the sound of furniture
    scraping around on the other side of the door."
  - "\"W-who is it?\" Asks \xC9lisabeth's muffled voice from the other side of the
    door."
  - There's no immediate answer when you knock on the door. All you hear is a panicked
    yelp, and the sound of furniture scraping around on the other side of the door.
  - You hear a sigh of relief from the other side of the door, and her voice sounds
    more steady when she says. "<i>Dieu merci</i>! You have no idea how glad I am
    to hear your voice."
  - '"Ah yes, I sent you a letter and now you''re here." She replies, sounding slightly
    steadier, but still a little rattled. "Everything is going to be alright..."'
  - '"What? Who''s there?" She replies, her voice cracking from the tension. "Is
    that you, Yvette?"'
  - (You have gained some favor with Elisabeth)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Elisabeth)
  - (You have lost a little favor with Elisabeth)
  - "After a moment the door opens, and you step inside \xC9lisabeth's studio. When
    your eyes adjust to the dim light, you see that she's standing there, looking
    a touch pale."
  - '"I''m so happy to see you. Where do I even begin?"'
  - '"I guess I should start with the most important parts. Someone tried to poison
    me, I lived, and now I''m terrified to the point of madness."'
  - '"It was late at night, and I was planning on spending a few more hours drawing
    some light and shadow studies, so I decided to make myself some coffee. Inspiration
    comes and goes, so I wanted to seize it while I could."'
  - '"However, after I took my first big sip, I noticed it just smelled... wrong."'
  - '"The smell was odd, almost like garlic, but that wasn''t enough for me to suspect
    poison. However, what happened next eliminated any of my doubts."'
  - '"I made it myself. I was born to a modest family, so I''m not above doing a
    little work in a kitchen. To be honest, I would have felt like a complete nuisance
    if I was to wake someone up, just for the sake of making me coffee."'
  - '"As strange as it sounds, my coffee smelled like... garlic. As stupid as it
    sounds, I took another sip, just to be sure I was right. I thought that perhaps
    something was wrong with my nose."'
  - '"As I was saying, I noticed that it smelled like garlic, and just to be sure
    I took a second sip. After that, my throat started to hurt. The burning was terrible,
    and I suddenly felt dizzy."'
  - '"Suddenly, after the second sip, my throat started to hurt. It felt like burning,
    and I started to feel dizzy."'
  - '"I started stumbling to the kitchen for water, but I suddenly threw up and...
    I swear on my life that this next part actually happened. My vomit was smoking!
    It was smoking on the ground like a little fire."'
  - '"Afterward, I spent a whole day in bed, tossing and turning. My husband, the
    servants, nobody knew what to do. Our doctor has been out of town for a week,
    so we didn''t know who to call. All I know is that my heart hurt, breathing hurt,
    everything in my chest just hurt awfully. I didn''t know who I could even trust!"'
  - '"Eventually, I realized that you were the only person I could really trust.
    You''re clever, used to intrigues, and you don''t have a motive to hurt me."'
  - "\xC9lisabeth sighs, still seeming genuinely shaken. \"What should I do next,
    then?\""
  - '"I''m so happy to see you, Yvette!" She calls out to you, before looking over
    your shoulder. "Wait... who is that?"'
  - "\"I'm Th\xE9r\xE8se, Madame Decaux's 'keeper of whispers', as it were.\" Your
    spy mistress says with a precise curtsey as she draws up next to you. \"I was
    told that there was a potential attempt on your life, and it was believed that
    my expertise might be of use to you.\""
  - "\"Why, exactly, do you keep someone like that as part of your staff?\" \xC9lisabeth
    asks, before shaking her head to clear the thought."
  - '"To get back to the point, I''m certain that someone has tried to poison me
    in my home. In my own home!"'
  - '"It was late at night, and I was planning on spending a few more hours drawing
    some light and shadow studies, so I decided to make myself some coffee. Inspiration
    comes and goes, so I wanted to seize it while I could."'
  - '"However, after I took my first big sip, I noticed it just smelled... wrong."'
  - '"The smell was odd, almost like garlic, but that wasn''t enough for me to suspect
    poison. However, what happened next eliminated any of my doubts."'

  - '"Eventually, I realized that you were the only person I could really trust.
    You''re clever, used to intrigues, and you don''t have a motive to hurt me."'
  - "\"An ingested poison with a faint garlic smell, which causes smoking bile, and
    injury to the heart...\" Th\xE9r\xE8se says quietly to herself as she flips through
    pages in the small black book that she always keeps on her person."
  - Suddenly, she snaps the book shut and looks up at the two of you. "All of these
    things point to phosphorous poisoning. It's commonly used to kill rats, and other
    vermin. It's both easy to obtain, and extremely lethal. You're lucky to be alive,
    Madame Le Brun."
  - '"Did they put it in my coffee because they hoped that it would mask the distinctive
    smell?" Elisabeth asks.'
  - '"That... actually makes a lot of sense. Yvette, you certainly seem to hire the
    right people."'
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - "\"Madame, I'm going to search the rest of the building for any evidence that
    might lead to this assassin.\" Th\xE9r\xE8se says to you. \"I leave the two of
    you to determine your next steps."
  - "With the sound of her boots clacking on the floorboards, Th\xE9r\xE8se leaves
    to begin her investigations."
  - '"You''re right. I need to see a doctor soon, even if our usual one is out of
    town. Thank you, Yvette. I''ve started worrying about so many things that I''ve
    stopped doing anything to solve any of them."'
  - '"That makes sense. I guess that it already helps that I feel too afraid to leave
    the house right now."'
  - '"That''s what I''m asking you! I really don''t know what to do!"'
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - '"I trust my husband''s servants, and he has no possible motive to hurt me, which
    all narrows the field of suspects significantly. The only person I could suspect
    is the man we buy our coffee from, Monsieur Toiry. I''m met him once or twice.
    He''s an older man with tremors in his hands, and he always seemed a little...
    odd. He usually has a stall set up at <i>Les Halles</i>, the market."'
  - ('Straight To The Source' is now available for you to visit on the Paris Map)
  - '"I''m sorry, but I need to lie down for a little while. This has been extremely
    draining," the painter sighs. "Would you mind letting yourself out?"'
  - "Th\xE9r\xE8se returns to you group with a frown on her face. \"Madame Le Brun,
    I can only confirm your suspicions. I examined the contents of your pantry, and
    all of your ground coffee has been tainted. I would advise emptying the entire
    pantry, just in case.\""
  - "You leave \xC9lisabeth to her recovery and head home. It's already starting
    to get late."
  - You spend your entire walk home considering every angle of this case. How could
    a simple coffee merchant become an assassin? What would have he even have to
    gain? These thoughts occupy you for the rest of the evening.
  - With a weary sigh, you continue your walk home, trying to drive the thoughts
    of assassins and caustic poisonings from your mind. Your efforts are only partly
    successful.
  - '"That makes sense, but sound advice, but I need to lie down for a little while.
    This has been extremely draining," the painter sighs. "Would you two mind letting
    yourselves out?"'
