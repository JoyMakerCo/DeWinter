  _nodeText:
  - The nighttime sky is overcast and the streets smell of freshly finished rain.
    You use one hand to adjust your hood while you look down at the directions Antoine
    provided in his letter. You glance around at the buildings and note that you've
    found yourself in one of the nicer neighborhoods in Paris. In fact, you're not
    from <i>La Place Royale</i>.
  - You've reached the end of your directions, so you must be in the right place.
    However, there's nothing that seems particularly special about this address.
    You glance around and find the streets to be empty. There's no sign of Antoine
    at all.
  - Suddenly, you feel a hand reach across your body, grab you by the shoulder and
    pull you into an alley.
  - When your eyes adjust to the light, you realize that your assailant is none other
    than Antoine. He's pressed so close to you against the wall, that you can feel
    his rapid heartbeat through his coat.
  - Before you can even utter a word, Hansel has his saber out and pointed at your
    assailant. His voice is a low ursine rumble "Unhand the woman, or die. Your choice."
  - You recognize the arm holding onto you as Antoine's. You also see a glint of
    silver in the dark as his hand is holding a long stiletto. His hand as steady
    as a stone, which is rather unusual for anyone who's been on the receiving end
    of Hansel's threats.
  - "Antoine's dagger arm relaxes, but the arm around you remains. \"<i>Je suis d\xE9sol\xE9</i>,
    I was hoping to play a joke on Madame Yvette here. I had no idea that she'd thought
    to hire a bodyguard. I didn't even notice you stalking behind her.\""
  - '"<i>Ja...</i>" Hansel replies, narrowing his eyes at the young revolutionary.
    Cautiously, they both sheathe their weapons at the same time. You note that Antoine''s
    keeps his stilletto concealed up his coat sleeve.'
  - With a grunt, Hansel steps away from the two of you and fades back into the shadows.
  - '"Thank you for joining me."'
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - Gesturing with the dagger, he continues "I'm sorry about the knife as well. I
    too like to stay protected, and drawing it was mere reflex."
  - '"I had a feeling that''d be the case." He replies with an approving smile.'
  - He nods respectfully to you. "Ah, straight to the point. I see."
  - '"No, but you don''t feel like ''every girl'' to me." He replies, flashing you
    a wolfish smile in the dark.'
  - Antoine lets go and smiles to you. "It looks like we both understand how dangerous
    things can be."
  - '"I see that you came. That''s good."'
  - Neither of you say anything for a long time. Instead, the two of you gaze upon
    each other in the dark, your lips hovering dangerously close.
  - Suddenly, he pulls away, releasing you.
  - (You have gained some credibility)
  - Antoine gestures behind himself to some buckets of paste and rolled-up posters.
    "I've managed to convince some sympathetic citizens to print up these posters
    that are rather objectionable to the Crown."
  - '"If we posted these in a poor neighborhood, one sympathetic to our cause, the
    watch wouldn''t hesitate to punish the people who live there. So instead, we''re
    taking our work directly to the heart of the problem." He gestures out of the
    alleyway to the wealthy neighborhood around you.'
  - '"Of course, I''m sure the watch will be sympathetic to the inhabitants of this
    neighborhood once we cover it in our messages. It also means that we get to make
    ourselves heard, and remind them all of the discontent brewing in France."'
  - '"The powerful only sleep comfortably at night because they''ve convinced themselves
    that the order they hold by force is the result of public will. They lie to themselves
    and pretend that their edicts are supported by a silent majority of commoners,
    instead of a regime of organized violence."'
  - He holds up a bucket and paste brush. "Let's challenge that notion, shall we?"
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - '"Are you ready to do something very direct, very fun, and very illegal?"'
  - Your curiosity piqued, you unroll one of them and examine it by the light of
    a guttering street lantern. The poster is a potent mixture of accurate political
    commentary, and extremely obscene imagery.
  - Moving as quickly as you can, you start pasting as many posters as you can, in
    as many obvious places as possible.
  - Taking your time, you start placing the posters under eaves, on hidden sides
    of staircases, and any other concealed place you can find.
  - With a mischievous grin, you carefully and quietly pry open the ground level
    shutters on some of the more opulent houses and paste the posters over their
    windows, facing inward. You strain your ears to listen for the sound of noise
    from within the homes.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - Antoine breaks into an equally wide smile when he spots your handiwork. "<i>Brilliante</i>"
    He whispers to you. "That'll certainly give them a start, when they wake up and
    see that, first thing in the morning."
  - (You have gained some favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained a little favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained a decent amount of favor with Antoine)
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - He gives you an upward nod of approval. "Good idea. There's no way they'll find
    all of them tomorrow. They'll be pulling these posters down for weeks."
  - He gives you an upward nod of approval. "That's the spirit. These should be visible
    to anyone who walks through here."
  - As you and Antoine continue to paper the neighborhood in posters, you feel giddy,
    almost child-like. There's something freeing about exerting your will over this
    place. A place home to people who wield more power in a single day than you've
    ever had in your whole life.
  - '"Every woman in the world looks better when she''s defacing the possessions
    of the powerful."'
  - Both of you freeze in place as you hear the sound of approaching footsteps. Those
    footsteps grow into the tramping of multiple sets of boots. The light of a lantern
    shines off a window far down the street.
  - '"That must be the archers. We haven''t been discovered yet, they''re walking,
    not running. Still, they''ll be here soon."'
  - '"We need to leave."'
  - He nods silently in agreement, and quietly sets his remaining materials on the
    ground. Once you do the same, he grabs you by the hand and leads you away.
  - '"Have you gone mad? You''re really willing to be arrested over this?"'
  - '"<i>Ja</i>" Hansel nods to you, appearing from his hidden position. You''re
    still unsure how a man that large can be so stealthy.'
  - '"But you especially... you shine brighter than any lantern in this city."'
  - '"That''s brilliant." Antoine says with an appreciative nod as he watches Hansel
    stall the watch. While they''re distracted, the two of you quickly put up the
    last of the posters, then make your escape.'
  - '"I knew there was a reason I liked you."'
  - (You have lost a little peril)
  - 'In the distance, you can hear the anger and disgust in watchmen''s voices as
    they eventually discover your handiwork. Their discontent grows louder and you
    can hear one of them shout "Find who did this! Find them now!"


    The two
    of you duck down a narrow alley together. '
  - Seized by the moment, you kiss him. At first, he's surprised, but quickly falls
    to the same adrenaline fueled passion as yourself. You can feel his fingers wrap
    tightly around the hair on the back of your head.
  - Signaling him with a tug on his shirt sleeve, you both head deeper into the alley
    to hide. While you are both otherwise still and silent, you can feel of the back
    of his hand idly stroke the back of your head, as he keeps watch.
  - One of the archers is close. Extremely close. You can smell the oil of his lantern,
    and the stench of tobacco on his uniform.
  - Antoine doesn't pull away from your embrace, but you can feel one of his hands
    moving around. In the darkness, you see the glint of steel as he draws a stiletto
    from his coat sleeve.
  - (You have gained a decent amount of favor with Antoine)
  - Instead of fleeing, the two of you gather up your materials and conceal yourselves
    in a nearby alley. You can heard their approaching boots as they get closer.
    You can hear the anger and disgust in their voices as they discover your handiwork.
  - (You have gained a decent amount of peril)

  - '(You have lost a little peril)

    (You have gained some favor with Antoine)'
  - In the close confines of your hiding place, you find yourself pressed up against
    Antoine.
  - One of the archers is close. Extremely close. Even from your position, you can
    smell the oil of his lantern, and the stench of tobacco on his uniform. You're
    glad that you chose to focus on concealing yourself.
  - Antoine doesn't pull away from your embrace, but you can feel one of his hands
    moving around. In the darkness, you see the glint of steel as he draws a stiletto
    from his coat sleeve.
  - You finally manage to exhale when the watchmen gives up searching in your area,
    to go investigate somewhere else.

  - You finally manage to exhale when the watchmen gives up searching in your area,

  - Carefully, the two of you sneak out of the alleyway and finish putting up your
    last posters together, before making your escape. Antoine looks ecstatic.
  - Antoine offers to walk you home, and you take him up on his offer. The two of
    you laugh and chat together, giddy from the adrenaline rush of what just transpired.
  - He walks you home, and gives you a silent upward nod before her turns to leave.
    Camille is waiting on your doorstep.
  - '"Welcome home, Madame!" Camille greets you. "How was your night out?"'
  - You skip upstairs to your room, replaying all of the nights events in your head,
    refusing to let go of the excitement. Despite how tired you are, you find it
    difficult to get to sleep.
  - You head upstairs to your room, imagining all the different ways that tonight
    could have gone wrong. Despite how tired you are, you find it difficult to get
    to sleep.
  - Without another word, he jogs down the street and gets the attention of the watchmen.
    While you can't make out the details of their conversation from this distance,
    your bodyguard seems to have simply dragged them into a slow, but pleasant conversation
    that would be difficult to escape.

  - "These fitful thoughts are interrupted when Th\xE9r\xE8se enters the room."
  - '"Pardon me for interrupting, madame, but I felt we should discuss your situation
    with the extremely dangerous man you just saw."'
  - '"While I would personally advise against this sort of thing, this information
    is still what you pay me to provide." She sighs. "Though he does his best to
    hide it, something from his past clearly haunts him. Joining him on a rendezvous
    may reveal more, and allow you to get closer to him."'
  - "Shaking her head, she leaves. \n\nFor the next hour or so, you struggle with
    your thoughts, and eventually slip into a deep sleep."
  - '"A regular rendezvous." She says with a frown. "Not a night spent committing
    acts of vandalism. Perhaps the theater would be to his tastes?"'
