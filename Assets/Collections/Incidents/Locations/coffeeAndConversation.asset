  _nodeText:
  - Strolling through central Paris, you weave your way through crowds of excited
    students, pontificating intellectuals, and agitated artists. It feels like every
    corner is home to another gallery, or part of the various academies strewn throughout
    the district.
  - "Your nose picks up the scent of fine coffee and you find yourself subconsciously
    gravitating towards the origin of this delightful smell. The closer you get to
    the source of the scent, the thicker the crowds become.\r"
  - "Eventually, you arrive at a bustling coffee house with large glass windows.
    The sign outside reads '<i>Cafe Principe</i>'. Your heart sinks at the site of
    the massive crowd of students milling around outside the cafe. It doesn\u2019t
    look like you\u2019ll be able to get in at all.\r"
  - "However, before you can give up on this venture, a woman in a coffee-stained
    apron emerges from the door. She loudly asks if any of the students are actually
    interested in buying anything, or if they\u2019re just hanging around to look
    important."
  - 'Sensing the hostility in this rhetorical question, the students quickly dissipate.
    Satisfied, the woman in the apron heads back inside. With the doorway cleared,
    you happily enter <i>Cafe Principe</i>. '
  - 'Inside, the coffee house is packed with customers engaged in animate conversation
    and gesticulating wildly with cups of steaming coffee. Growing up, you were often
    told that religion and politics made for poor conversation, but it appears that
    none of these people got the same message. '
  - "Finding a seat at an empty table, you\u2019re approached by the woman from before.\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Bonjour</i> madame, my name is Marguerite and let me be the first to
    welcome you to <i>Cafe Principe</i>!\u201D "
  - "\u201CWhat can I get you?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, certainly madame!\u201D she replies happily."
  - "\u201C...\u201D"
  - "You gesture around the cafe as you ask the question, and the woman follows your
    gesture as it accidentally points towards a portly older man surrounded by a
    group of politely giggling young women. \u201COh, that?\u201D she asks. \u201CThat
    man is Monsieur Boehmer, he\u2019s a regular.\u201D "
  - 'She gives you a quick curtsey before she checks in with another table, taking
    their order as well. You sigh and take in the cafe around you. The whole place
    hums with excitement, as patrons make new pronouncements and trade verbal barbs
    with their compatriots. '
  - "She returns with your coffee, steaming and hot. The porcelain cup clinks lightly
    as she sets it down, along with containers of sugar and milk. \r"
  - "Before you mix in anything, you decide to taste the coffee by itself. It\u2019s
    bitter and acidic, but also full and potent. Very potent. You now understand
    why the customers are all so energetic.\r"
  - "\u201CIf you insist, madame, I\u2019ll leave you to your refreshments.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Oui</i>, madame. I shall fetch you free water, while you occupy a table
    in our busy cafe.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIs there anything else I can get you?\u201D\r"
  - With a scowl, she skulks away to attend to the other customers, while you applaud
    yourself for your thriftiness. She shortly returns with your water, which is
    surprisingly cool and refreshing.
  - "Instantly, the woman is all smiles, once again. \u201COh yes, an excellent choice
    madame!\u201D"
  - '"As for the women, they are... prostitutes."'
  - "At the sound of fresh giggling from Monsieur Boehmer\u2019s table she leans
    in close to you and whispers behind her hand \u201CHe\u2019s not actually that
    funny, the laughing is just good for business.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIs there anything else you\u2019d like to know about?\u201D"
  - "\u201COh, the cafe!\u201D the woman exclaims, suddenly understanding your point.
    \u201CDon\u2019t worry, everything here is pretty simple. I\u2019ve watched it
    play out with our patrons the same way every day, for the last few years.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CFirst you come in and sit down, and order something. While we can\u2019t
    make you order anything, we would strongly prefer that you order some coffee.\u201D
    She stops to stare at you significantly for a moment. "
  - "\u201CAfter you get your drink, you can settle in alongside our patrons here.
    They're all obsessed with politics, so it\u2019s easy to find out who among the
    high and mighty is doing well at the moment. Everything's always shifting in
    Paris, so it\u2019s nice to come in regularly, and stay informed.\""
  - "\"Once you\u2019ve listened for a while, you\u2019ll probably get dragged into
    one of the debates. Be careful with your answer, as news travels fast. Depending
    on who you support, you can earn favor with people from one faction, but lose
    it with another.\""
  - "\u201CAfter that? You head home with a little more energy, a little more knowledge,
    and hopefully you\u2019re a little more well liked. That\u2019s all there is,
    really!\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CNow, if you can excuse me madame, I must get back to my other tables.\u201D"
  - "She favors you with a quick curtsey before leaving, and you get settled in.
    It feels familiar, like a louder and livelier version of <i>\u2018Le Cygne\u2019</i>,
    the public house you used to frequent back home"
  - "You sip at your drink, and get settled in. It feels familiar, like a louder
    and livelier version of <i>\u2018Le Cygne\u2019</i>, a public house you used
    to frequent back home."
  - "\"\x1CEnjoy, madame!\x1D\" she says before curtseying again and leaving to attend
    to the other customers.\r"
  - (You have spent 3 Livres)
  - "\"\x1CThe coffee also perks you up, and makes you less exhausted, if you\x19're
    feeling tired. It'\x19s no substitute for sleep, but it'\x19s a start!\x1D\r\""
  - (You have lost one level of exhaustion)
  - (You currently have no levels of exhaustion. Coffee can reduce exhaustion, but
    it cannot make you well rested)
  - 'You''re absolutely certain that your waitress is the woman that used to work
    for Maximin all those years ago. However, you''ll have to visit sometime later
    to engage her about that particular suspicion.


    Today, you''re just focused
    on coffee and conversation.'
