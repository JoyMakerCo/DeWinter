  _nodeText:
  - "A warm breeze caresses your skin as you check the address that \xC9lisabeth
    gave you a few nights ago, confirming that you're heading to the right place."
  - "\"That's very brave of you.\" \xC9lisabeth says with a smile. \"I normally spend
    so much time trying to flatter my clients that the truth might be an interesting
    challenge.\" "
  - "\xC9lisabeth walks in, wearing a paint spattered apron, and carrying a freshly
    stretched canvas, while you're still in the middle of your inspection. \"<i>Salut</i>
    Yvette! Please come in, and close the door quietly, I don't want my husband's
    servant to hear us.\""
  - Every time you pass a stranger on the street, you expect them to know, somehow.
    To know that you're on your way to a beautiful, fascinating woman's studio so
    that she can paint a nude portrait of you for her private collection.
  - How best to proceed?
  - You rap your knuckles against the door, elegantly but firmly.
  - Not wanting to make too much noise, you open the door and step inside the studio.
    The place is clean, though it's still spattered with dried paint. Shrubs and
    ivies growing over the windows provide some privacy, but still let the sunlight
    filter in.
  - 'The door suddenly opens just wide enough for you to see Elisabeth''s startled
    face.


    "Yvette, is that you?"'
  - She leads you to a couch, upholstered in satin. "I'll need you to undress and
    pose for me here."
  - 'Nervously, you begin to fumble with the ties and toggles of your dress.


    As
    you strip down to your foundation garments, you utter a silent prayer of thanks
    to the fact that it''s a warm day, so at least you won''t be shivering on the
    couch.'
  - If you're going to do something, you might as well do it right.
  - '"Well, it''s a nude portrait of you reclining on that couch, though I think
    you figured that part out already." Elisabeth says with a giggle as she sets
    up her canvas and paints.'
  - Shutting the door behind you, she says "I'm sorry for that, I'm just worried
    my husband's servants heard you."
  - "Finally, you undo your stays and with a sigh, let your linen chemise fall to
    the floor. You take a deep breath, your lungs freed from the restrictions of
    corsetry.\n\n\"Do you feel better?\" \xC9lisabeth asks, leading you over to the
    couch."
  - '"That was... something else." Elisabeth manages to stammer to you.'
  - "After spending more than a few moments admiring you, \xC9lisabeth gives you
    some specifics on how to pose. A wrist here, an ankle there, laying your head
    back in order to better catch the light on your face."
  - '"If you''re feeling nervous, then just think about the fact that you''re one
    of the most beautiful people to ever grace this furniture." She says with a sly
    grin.


    You take a seat, feeling more at ease, despite the unfamiliar situation.'
  - '"That''s why you should be naked, laying on my beautiful couch."'
  - 'Taken aback by your comment, her face flushes a rose red.


    "Well, perhaps
    I had some ulterior motives..."'
  - She reaches out and gently takes you by the hand. "There's no need to be shy.
    I've painted hundreds of people before."
  - 'She walks to her easel and using a piece of charcoal, starts to sketch out your
    position on the canvas. You can''t see what she''s doing, but you can hear her
    mumble to herself while she works.


    From the sounds of it, the sketching
    is going well.'
  - A few minutes pass and you realize how comfortable you are, despite your vulnerable
    position. Being naked no longer feels different. Like plunging into cold water,
    the initial shock is really the most noticeable part.
  - Eventually, like the water, it just feels calm and refreshing.
  - "A few hours pass, punctuated only by the occasional break to get up and stretch.
    \xC9lisabeth won't let you look at the canvas on your breaks, so instead you
    content yourself with staring out the window, at the way the sunlight plays with
    the leaves on the vines."
  - '"Oh, I wouldn''t recommend that. Painting Queens only seems to lead to trouble
    for me."'
  - "\xC9lisabeth doesn't reply at first. Instead she stares at you quizzically,
    as if she's uncertain that you're serious."
  - She starts drawing again with a fresh energy, scribbling with her charcoal all
    over the canvas.
  - She looks at you, seemingly with fresh eyes, and starts scribbling furiously
    on her canvas. Judging by the sounds of her muttering, she's enjoying the challenge.
  - Still, you can tell that she's keeping your request in mind. She spends the next
    few minutes correcting a few lines of her charcoal.
  - "When you finally break for the day, \xC9lisabeth takes off her canvas apron,
    makes some tea, and brings out a few small pastries while you get dressed. In
    the midst of devouring said pastries, you realize that you're suprisingly hungry
    for someone who's spent the day sitting in one place."
  - After spending an hour chatting and looking at your figure sketched out on the
    canvas, you decide to head home. Out in the street, your footsteps feel lighter,
    the world seems brighter, and more in focus.
  - '"Get in, get in!" She whispers to you, motioning you inside. '
  - '"To be specific, I''ve spent so much time painting clothed figures, that I feel
    like I''m losing touch with my fundamentals. This will let me practice my anatomy
    rendering, and the satin on the couch will let me keep current on my fabric skills."'
  - 'Your skin slides along the cool satin, as you get settled into place. Elisabeth
    gently arranges your pose, one limb at a time, helping you settle into just the
    right position.


    "Alright, you''re doing your part just fine. It''s time
    for me to do mine!"'
  - Keeping that in mind, you stride over to the couch, slowly disrobing as you walk.
    The line of discarded clothing forms a trail behind you until finally, you drape
    your corset over the back of the couch, and slowly recline into a comfortable
    position.
  - '"Are you sure you''ve never done this before?"


    You give no reply, other
    than an appropriately enigmatic smile.'
  - '"I have the framing and positioning set, how would you like me to depict you?"'
  - What a day.
  - Eventually, she breaks into a broad smile. "I think I'd like that very much."
  - 'You glance back down at the paper, then at the number on the house. You''re
    here.


    The studio feels like a separate building that''s been attached to
    her house, and while you assume that her husband is at work, you can see the
    shapes of servants through the home''s windows.'
  - You feel nervous. You feel anticipation.
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - Taking a moment to compose herself, she smiles. "I'm really glad you've decided
    to do this."
  - "(You've gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You've gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "You'll have to return at a later date, in order for \xC9lisabeth to finish this
    painting."
