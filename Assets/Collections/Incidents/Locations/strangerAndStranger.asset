  - At home, it takes all day for you to finally work up the nerve and do this. Just
    as the sun sets, you finally pull the note and key out from under your stays.
    The paper is covered in unfamiliar handwriting written in rich, emerald ink.
  - '''<i>Cher</i> Armand,


    I will always appreciate your commitment to our
    cause, and I know France will be better for it. However, our chance of being
    caught grows with every passing day. I will not waste ink painting terrible pictures
    of the consequences, as you are already familiar with them.'''
  - "\u2018If fortune turns against us, then I want you to flee Paris entirely, and
    head to the border. If you show them my ring, then my society's sponsors will
    protect you. I know you\u2019ve objected to this idea before, but it\u2019s the
    only way for you to stay safe. To aid in this, I\u2019ve secreted a package under
    the loose floorboards beneath your stove. This key will open it.\u2019\n\nYou
    look at the key. It\u2019s still here, so Armand never received the note."
  - "\u2018Your partner in conspiracy,\n\nJohanna\u2019"
  - "You turn over the letter and find no additional writing, no additional context
    or explanation. \n\nWho is Johanna? How long has Armand known her for? Is she
    one of the people he\u2019d been writing back home?"
  - "Heading downstairs, you walk into the kitchen. It\u2019s clean but cramped,
    and Camille keeps it well stocked with fresh produce. You find the stove, made
    of dark iron and standing on a set of clawed feet. \n\nAlone, on your hands and
    knees, you feel around until you find a set of loose floorboards."
  - 'You pull up the floorboards and fish around in the dark until you find a small
    wooden box, held shut by a padlock. You open it with the key you found behind
    the painting. '
  - Inside the box you find a magnetic compass, a map of Paris with notes concerning
    when the guards change at every one of the city gates, a signet ring, and a leather
    bag heavy with coins.
  - "You look inside the bag\u2026 that\u2019s a lot of coins."
  - You look up from your sudden windfall to see Camille standing in the doorway
    to the kitchen. Her eyes are darting between you and the box in confusion.
  - "\"I was just about to start making dinner\u2026\" Camille says, pointing awkwardly
    at the stove."
  - "\"Kn-know about what?\" Camille asks, glancing between you and the bag of coins
    in your hands. \"Was that Monsieur Armand\u2019s? Why would he leave money in
    the house?\""
  - "\"Madame, what\u2019s going on?\""
  - "\"I never asked anyone\u2019s names, madame.\u201D Camille admits, looking downcast.
    \u201CSo many of Monsieur Armand\u2019s guests valued their privacy, that I wanted
    to give them a polite amount of space.\""
  - '"However..." Camille straightens up, tapping her finger on her chin. "There
    was a woman who came by more frequently than the other guests. She had brown
    hair, and a scar on her chin. I think I remember her because she always wore
    a necklace, with the prettiest emerald in the center of it."'
  - You look down at the green ink used the write the note to Armand. Is there are
    a connection?
  - "\"That\u2019s all I can remember madame. Now\u2026 if I may ask, can I have
    the kitchen to myself? I\u2019d like to start making your dinner.\""
  - (You have gained 100 Livres)
  - (You have lost quite a bit of peril)

  - The notes on the map will make it much easier to traverse the city without being
    noticed, by the <i>Guet Royal</i>, or by anyone else.
  - For the first time since you've met her, you feel like Camille might not be telling
    the truth.
  - '"Why did he leave?" She asks nervously.'
  - '"A few weeks ago, when Monsieur Armand still lived here... some men came here
    in the middle of the night. I don''t know why but they tried to hurt him." Camille
    says, her voice low and afraid. "I was in the cellar getting wine, so I hid down
    there in the dark until the screaming stopped."'
  - '"Madame, I simply don''t know what you''re talking about." Camille replies in
    a rush, fidgeting with her apron.'
  - Before you can ask any further questions, Camille ushers you out, into the hallway.
    The door shuts quickly behind you and all you can hear is the clattering of pots
    and pans as she starts furiously preparing food.
  - '"Now, I still have to make you dinner, so I''m going to have to ask you to leave
    the kitchen."'
  - 'You look over the signet ring that was included in the box. It''s a finely made
    silver ring with a signet used for pressing seals in wax. You don''t recognize
    the symbol on the ring, but the piece of jewelry itself looks very old. '
  - '"Monsieur Armand managed to fight them off, but he was hurt and thought that
    these men would come back for him. So, packed his things, wrote the note for
    you, and left. He thought that if he wasn''t here, they''d keep chasing after
    him and you''d be safe."'
  - '"I was supposed to tell you what happened, but this house is just so big and
    empty... by the time you arrived, I was so lonely. I was afraid that if you knew
    the whole story then you''d leave, and I''d be alone again."'
  - '"I''m so sorry madame! I never wanted to lie to you. I just... I just..."'
  - '"<i>Merci beaucoups</i>!" She yelps in relief. "I promise to never keep anything
    from you again!"'
  - '"No... that''s everything I have. I''m not much of one for secrets and intrigues."'
  - "Camille looks utterly shocked when you press the money into her hands. \"Madame
    I can't possibly take this, it\x19s too much, it\x19s too...\" she trails off
    as she evaluates your expression, and composes herself a moment later."
  - You're starting to wonder if this investigation will ever start answering more
    questions than it asks.
  - Camille looks down at the money in her hand, then back at you, and sighs. "When
    you first came here, I didn't tell you the whole truth of Monsieur Armand's disappearance."
  - '"I should probably start making you dinner, hopefully this news will be better
    on a full stomach. Madame, I''ll have to ask you to leave the kitchen, while
    I work."'
  - "\"Ex-explain what?\" Camille asks, glancing between you and the bag of coins
    in your hands. \"Was that Monsieur Armand'\x19s? Why would he leave money in
    the house?\""
  - '"I don''t think I''m very good at them."'
  - At your call, your spymistress enters the room.
  - "\"I'd like to warn you, Camille, against lying to the lady of the house.\" Th\xE9r\xE8se
    says gently, but firmly. \"Falsehood is clearly not in your nature, and now would
    be a truly poor time to start practicing it.\""
  - '"Uh... uh..."'
  - '"A few weeks ago, when Monsieur Armand still lived here... some men came here
    in the middle of the night. I don''t know why but they tried to hurt him." Camille
    says, her voice low and afraid. "I was in the cellar getting wine, so I hid down
    there in the dark until the screaming stopped."'
  - '"Monsieur Armand managed to fight them off, but he was hurt and thought that
    these men would come back for him. So, packed his things, wrote the note for
    you, and left. He thought that if he wasn''t here, they''d keep chasing after
    him and you''d be safe."'
  - '"I was supposed to tell you what happened, but this house is just so big and
    empty... by the time you arrived, I was so lonely. I was afraid that if you knew
    the whole story then you''d leave, and I''d be alone again."'

  - '"No... that''s everything I have. I''m not much of one for secrets and intrigues."'
  - '"I don''t think I''m very good at them."'
  - '"I should probably start making you dinner, hopefully this news will be better
    on a full stomach. I''ll have to ask you both to leave the kitchen, while I work."'
  - Before you can ask any further questions, Camille ushers you both out, into the
    hallway. The door shuts quickly behind you and all you can hear is the clattering
    of pots and pans as she starts furiously preparing food.
