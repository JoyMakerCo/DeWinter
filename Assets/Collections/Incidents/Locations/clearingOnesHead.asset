  _nodeText:
  - You spend the day walking along the river with Camille. You didn't feel like
    going out along, and he was helpful enough to volunteer.
  - Then again, it's not like there's anyone else in your house to ask.
  - The two of you walk side by side as you chat. While this kind of public familiarity
    with one's servants is certainly a breach of etiquette, it's also much harder
    to have a conversation with someone walking a respectful distance behind you.
    Camille was a little uncomfortable with this new arrangement at first, but she's
    enjoying the change of pace.
  - '"You know, madame, I''ve been in Paris my whole life and I''ve never once swam
    in the Seine?" She says, gesturing to the river. "My brothers used to play in
    it all the time when they were little, but I never really got around to it. Now
    if I stripped down and went in the river, everyone would think I''d gone mad."'
  - You find yourself so absorbed in this idea that you nearly walk straight into
    Alex, who was standing at the water's edge, uncharacteristically quiet.
  - '"Ah! My apologies Yvette. I didn''t see you there."'
  - '"Not at the moment. Right now, I''m merely stretching my legs and doing my best
    to clear my head. To put it simply, I adore this city. It''s been years and I
    still like to wander its streets for the sake of finding some new sight I''ve
    missed."'
  - '"Ah, it''s that obvious then? Yes, I''ve run across something particularly troubling
    during the course of my duties, and I needed to clear my head."'
  - '"Today, I was called in to deal with something... extremely unpleasant, and
    I must admit that it''s disquieted me more than I expected it to."'
  - '"Not at the moment. Right now, I''m merely stretching my legs and doing my best
    to clear my head. It''s as I told you when we first met, I truly adore this city.
    It''s been years and I still like to wander its streets for the sake of finding
    some new sight I''ve missed."'
  - "\"Actually, now that I consider the details, I\u2019m not sure you need to hear
    this\u2026\""
  - Alex doesn't say anything at first. Instead, he stares out at the river for some
    time.
  - '"Yvette, that''s unfair and you know it."'
  - '"<i>Merci beaucoups</i>, I appreciate your willingness to let this go. As much
    as I''m delighted by your natural curiosity, I don''t think I could have been
    comfortable discussing that."'
  - ' "It was barely dawn when my unit was called in to help search the scene of
    a murder in the city. The police have been overburdened since that business with
    Reveillon, so they asked for our assistance."'
  - '"I''m sorry Yvette, but I just can''t talk about this."'
  - '"Don''t worry, Monsieur Dumas! I''m certain that Madame Yvette can-"'
  - '"I saw the body and learned the details of the case. I''ve seen my fair share
    of violence but this felt different, somehow. The victim, an elderly merchant,
    was pinned face-down on a table, and had his throat slit like an animal. What
    distresses me more is that a woman was seen fleeing the scene, carrying a bundle
    of papers."'
  - '"The woman that fled the scene was wearing a green dress, and nobody seemed
    to recognize her. Perhaps it''s naive of me to think this way, but to imagine
    a woman to be involved in such wanton brutality has been truly unsettling."'
  - '"Monsieur Dumas, I bumped into your friend, Monsieur d''Auvergne while I was
    at the market. He told me all of these amazing stories of your adventures in
    the dragoons together!"'
  - "At this, Alex's face takes on a suspiciously neutral expression. \"Oh really?
    It's funny you say that. He\u2019s spoken to me about you, on several occasions.
    You seem to have made quite the impression on him.\""
  - '"Well, there''s only one way for us to test that claim!" Alex laughs, holding
    his arm out at shoulder height. "Grab on!"'
  - '"It''s kind of funny to think that there are certain things you''re only allowed
    to do when you''re younger. It''s even funnier when you think the adults are
    the one who make the rules. We can''t go splashing in the river because it''d
    be indecent, but we''re the ones who decide if that''s true!"'
  - '"Can you imagine if there was an Estates General for what''s adult and what''s
    childish? We could come together and petition the King to declare things like
    ''Bitter foods aren''t more sophisticated'' and ''Nothing is funnier than watching
    a mean and angry person fall down while they''re shouting''."'
  - (You have lost a little favor with Alex)
  - '"Fine..." He sighs. "If you wish to know so dearly, my unit was called in to
    help search the scene of a murder in the city. The police have been overburdened
    since that business with Reveillon, so they asked for our assistance."'
  - '"No, I will not hear of it!" Alex barks, his decision final. "I appreciate your
    curiosity, and I''m sorry for bringing it up, but I will not discuss this further."'
  - '(You have lost a little favor with Alex)

    (You have lost some credibility)'
  - '"<i>Pardon</i>, but I must take my leave." He says stiffly, leaving before you
    even get a chance to respond.'
  - '"Well, we tried madame, and nobody can hold that against us!" Camille says,
    in a game attempt to lift your spirits.'
  - You continue with your walk, trying not to over analyze the situation. You manage
    to be half successful in your efforts, and have a decently relaxing walk.
  - (You have gained a little favor with Alex)
  - Alex decides to join the two of you on your walk. While your unusual trio manages
    to attract a few stares, it's a small price to pay for good company.
  - "\"He also said that you were the strongest man in all of France! Is that true?\r\""
  - Without even a moment's hesitation, Camille jumps up and grabs onto Alex's outstretched
    arm, swinging from it like a child on a treebranch. To his credit, he holds her
    up with remarkable ease.
  - You both walk for a while in silence, considering the implications of such a
    thing. Considering what could motivate someone towards such things. Could you
    be pushed to do such a thing, by desperation or necessity?
  - '"...that''s a fair point." He laughs. "I''ve never known you to be one to shrink
    from difficulty. My apologies, Yvette, for underestimating you so quickly."'
  - (You have gained some favor with Alex)
  - Eventually, Camille stops attempting to climb Alex like a tree for long enough
    that you're all able to continue your walk along the river. The conversation
    is light, and it seems to do quite a bit for calming the dragoon's nerves.
  - As your time together comes to a close, Alex insists on walking you back to your
    home. Camille heads inside, to get dinner started.
  - '"I just wanted say ''thanks'', Yvette, for helping me take my mind off of today.
    You always seem to know how to brighten even the dourest of my moods."'
  - '"I just wanted say ''thanks'', Yvette, for helping me take my mind off of today.
    I seem to be cursed with a tendency to crawl into my own head, and dwell upon
    my problems. It''s nice to have someone who can pry me out of such dreadful reveries."'
  - 'Then, with a bow as formal and precise as always, he departs.


    Today seems
    to have gone quite well.'
  - '"I hope that you find me to be similarly invigorating." '
  - '"Unfortunately, I must go, but I hope to see you again, under better circumstances."'

  - '"It''s quite alright. Are you on duty at the moment?"'
  - '"Alex, you seem troubled."'
  - 
  - '"It''s quite alright. Are you on duty at the moment?"'
  - 
  - 
  - '"Alex, I''m made of sterner stuff than that. You can tell me."'
  - '"Ah, so you don''t think I can withstand the burden of a simple story?"'
  - '"It''s alright, you don''t need to discuss it, if you don''t want to."'
