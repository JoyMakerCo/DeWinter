  - "It's another warm, sunny day as you walk to \xC9lisabeth's studio. A fresh breeze
    off the river Seine prevents the heat from becoming overwhelming."
  - Having been to her studio before, you arrive without any trouble.
  - You knock lightly on the door, and wait. Listening closely, you hear some frantic
    movement inside.
  - "Remembering \xC9lisabeth's need for discretion, you simply walk inside. The
    studio is exactly how you remember it, though your portrait's canvas has been
    covered with a cloth."
  - "The door opens a fraction and you can see \xC9lisabeth through the gap.\n\n\"What
    did I say last time, about staying quiet?\" She whispers to you through her teeth.
    \"We need to be discreet.\""
  - "Entering the room, a startled \xC9lisabeth practically jumps when she sees you.
    \"<i>Mon Dieu</i>!\""
  - '"Alright, I already have everything I need set up. Let''s begin, shall we?"'
  - "\xC9lisabeth heads to her canvas and throws off the covers, while you strip
    down and position yourself on the couch, the same as you were before. "
  - This time, she starts with her paints, filling in the colors that define the
    scene. While you can't see what she's doing, she tells you about the process.
  - An hour into the sitting, she laughs. "I like how easy it is to talk to you.
    Much easier than trying to reach out to new patrons. Half of the critics in the
    city already paint me as a conniving narcissist, and I'd hate to prove any of
    them right."
  - '"At this point, I don''t even know who would appreciate my work."'
  - '"You really think so?" She asks, already considering the idea. "I guess they
    would, and none of my commissioned work is truly immodest, so perhaps they''ll
    actually appreciate my paintings."'
  - '"You really think so?" She asks, already considering the idea. "I guess that
    makes sense. It''s a lot easier to pitch yourself when you have something different
    to offer." '
  - '"That feels sensible." She admits, already considering the idea. "What I need
    right now is clients, and I''d rather have ones that can pay well than ones that
    can''t." '
  - '"Thanks Yvette! I''ll send out letters to the bishops in Paris tomorrow."'
  - '"Thanks Yvette! I''ll send out letters to some of the military officers in Paris
    tomorrow."'
  - '"Thanks Yvette! I''ll send out letters to some of the business leaders in Paris
    tomorrow."'
  - "The conversation trails off and you spend the next hour simply posing and watching
    \xC9lisabeth paint. She seems more relaxed, as if a weight has been lifted from
    her mind. "
  - '"Alright, my hands are starting to cramp up, so I think we''re done for the
    day."'
  - '"Do you want to see what I''ve done so far?"'
  - '"Here it is!" the painter says as she waves you over to her easel. The wooden
    floor creaks under your bare feet as you walk over. '
  - '"Oh really? Very interesting."'
  - "While the painting is obviously unfinished, the colors of the scene are balanced
    and you can see that \xC9lisabeth has already started on some of your details,
    but everything is smoother. Cleaner. The kind of unreal beauty that you've seen
    in so many portraits of great men and women."
  - While the painting is obviously unfinished, the colors of the scene are balanced
    and you can see that Elisabeth has already started on some of the details that
    make you yourself. A wrinkle here, a childhood scar there. The minor flaws of
    your body, quite literally laid bare.
  - While the painting is obviously unfinished, the colors of the scene are balanced
    and you can already see certain details of your body. It's not what you see in
    the mirror, but it's a familiar beauty. A lot of time has been spent on your
    eyes, capturing something that feels passionate, yet calculating and enigmatic.
  - "Afterwards, \xC9lisabeth provides you with pastries and tea again. You get the
    feeling that she does this with all of her clients, but it's nice to have all
    the same. You chat and joke for a while, which is a lot easier to do, now that
    you don't have to hold perfectly still."
  - "With things winding down, you decide it's time to head home. With a wave goodbye
    to \xC9lisabeth, you take your leave."
  - 'You turn your back on the painter and start to disrobe, one article at a time.
    It''s slow, but confident. After all, if you had anything to hide, you wouldn''t
    be here, doing this. '
  - '"Oh, I thought you''d never ask." Elisabeth replies with a sly smile. She helps
    you out of your dress, and slowly unlaces your stays, hands lingering on you
    all the while. '
  - '"No matter, if anyone asks, I''ll just say it was a courier with a message."
    She says with a sigh. "Come in, come in."'
  - '"I''m sorry, I just didn''t hear you come in."


    She flashes you a smile.
    "Still, I''m glad you took my request seriously."'
  - "You follow her inside and \xC9lisabeth closes the door behind you. The studio
    is exactly how you remember it, though your portrait's canvas has been covered
    with a cloth."
  - "\"I don't think I'll ever tire of that.\" \xC9lisabeth sighs."
  - '"So, instead, I just sit around and wait for work to come to me, even though
    I know it''s unwise. Artists have to keep reaching out for clients, or we''ll
    never get anything."


    She sighs. "Yet, I''m so out of practice. What if
    I make a fool of myself?"'
  - "Like last time, \xC9lisabeth fetches some pastries and tea. You get the feeling
    that she does this with all of her clients, but it's nice to have all the same.
    You chat and joke for a while, which is a lot easier to do, now that you don't
    have to hold perfectly still."
  - "(You have lost a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - You're pretty sure it took longer to undress with her help than it would have
    taken to do by yourself, but that wasn't the point really, was it?
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - Languidly, you sit on the couch and remove your stockings, before posing yourself.
  - "(You have gained some favor with \xC9lisabeth)"
  - Getting the balance of colors is important to making a scene feel authentic,
    even to an untrained eye. Subtle details like the color of the light reflected
    off a wall can make all the difference in the world.
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(The Bourgeoisie has moved
    towards the Crown some)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(The Military has moved
    towards the Crown some)"
  - "(You have gained a little favor with \xC9lisabeth)\n(The Church has moved towards
    the Crown some)"
  - It's not you as you are. It's you as you aspire to be.
  - Yet still, there's an honest beauty to it, if you do say so yourself.
  - It's fascinating to see how you appear through the eyes of another.
  - "You'll have to return one last time, so that \xC9lisabeth can finish this portrait."
  - ('The Final Sitting' is now available for you to visit on the Paris map)
  - Until then, you would like to rest.
