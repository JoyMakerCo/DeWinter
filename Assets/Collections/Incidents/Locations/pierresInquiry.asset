  - "Pierre\u2019s office either looks marginally cleaner than before, or he\u2019s
    managed to shuffle the mess into differently shaped piles. Honestly, it\u2019s
    hard to tell. "
  - "\"\x1C...you are trying to find someone, <i>non</i>?\x1D\""
  - "You spend a few moments waiting around in the entryway before Pierre arrives,
    and he seems quite enthused by your presence. \u201CWhy, if it isn\u2019t my
    newest confidant! Please come in! Have you come back with more delicious information,
    or perhaps\u2026\u201D"
  - "\u201CMadame, my suspicions about your search were founded in your\u2026 newfound
    notoriety.\u201D\r"
  - "Pierre cocks an eyebrow at your response and rummages around in his snuff box
    while he examines you more closely.\r"
  - "\u201COh, playing your cards carefully? I admire that, Madame.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CSuspicions, which you have been so kind as to confirm for me.\u201D Pierre
    favors you with a short and elegant bow. \u201C<i>Merci beaucoups</i>\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CAs for your fianc\xE9\u2019s whereabouts, I don\u2019t know his exact
    address, or I would probably be a wealthier man by now.\u201D Pierre admits,
    pausing to examine your reaction. \u201CHowever, I happen to have some leads,
    and I can say that I already like you more than some of the men that are looking
    for him.\u201D"
  - "\u201CHowever, before I lay out my terms, I must satisfy my own professional
    curiosity. How well do you really know your beloved Armand?\u201D"
  - "\u201CAh yes, the sting of desertion can certainly sour one\u2019s opinion.
    Your Armand has been so thoughtless as to abandon you in this cruel city, this
    den of vipers, and now you seek to chart your own course, <i>non</i>?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI doubt anyone could blame you for wanting to seize your own destiny,
    instead of chasing his.\u201D"
  - "\"\x1CNow then, to business?\x1D\""
  - "\u201CI am referring to your absent fianc\xE9, the Baron Armand de Marbo.\u201D
    He pauses to snort a small pinch of snuff, carefully examining your face for
    any hint of reaction."
  - "\u201CEver since making your acquaintance, I knew something about you was familiar,
    and my keen journalistic senses are never wrong! Your beloved Armand was quite
    the social butterfly, and he mentioned you often.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIn fact, like any good lover, he knew quite a lot about you. But how much
    did you really know about him?\u201D"
  - (You have lost a little credibility)
