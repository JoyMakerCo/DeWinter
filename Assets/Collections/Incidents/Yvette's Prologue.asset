  - "The carriage rumbles and bounces along the cobbles as you approach Paris. It\u2019s
    taken over a week to get here, even carrying just yourself and your luggage. "
  - "You must have read the brief letter over a hundred times, but you always found
    new details to puzzle over. Armand\u2019s letters were usually so long, a habit
    would you often tease him for, in your own missives."
  - "\u2018<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette, \r\n\r\nI know it may be sudden, but I want to
    invite you to live with me in Paris.\u2019\r"
  - "Not that your parents cared much about the romance. At first you\u2019d been
    afraid to tell them their youngest daughter wanted to move far away. Instead,
    they nearly threw you onto the carriage to follow Armand to Paris. "
  - "After all, \u2018Baroness Yvette de Marbo\u2019 has a certain ring to it..."
  - "You crane your neck out the window to peer at Paris. It\u2019s even more than
    you imagined. The streets are a riot of color and energy as people go about their
    days. Elegant persons of fashion strut like brilliant peacocks. Students stumble
    under the weight of their books. Beggars alternate between pleading for alms,
    and shouting invectives at passers-by."
  - "After a quiet sigh, the coachman obediently flicks at the reins and the horses
    up their pace to a brisk trot. The city blurs by as you quickly make your way
    towards The Orphan\u2019s Feast, the tavern where Armand said he would meet you. "
  - "When you arrive, the coachman helps you out of the carriage and you find yourself
    outside a glowing, friendly looking tavern. \r"
  - The sign shows a grubby looking child, holding with a plate piled high with fresh
    bread and roasted meats.
  - "For now though, you\u2019ve already finished all of your books and Armand's letter
    is your only entertainment, other than staring out the window. "
  - Though part of you is worried by your unfamiliar surroundings, you mostly feel
    excited. This place is to be the stage for your new life.

  - Though part of you is worried by your unfamiliar surroundings, you mostly feel
    excited. This place is to be the stage for your new life.
  - "Before you know it, the carriage starts slowing down. You must be here!\n\nArmand
    arranged to meet you at tavern named The Orphan\u2019s Feast. As tired and rumpled
    as you are, you\u2019re glad that he planned to meet you in a place with ample
    food and wine.\r"
  - "You must have read the brief letter over a hundred times, but you always found
    new details to puzzle over. Armand\u2019s letters were usually so long, a habit
    would you often tease him for, in your own missives."
  - "'<i>Ch\xE8re</i> Yvette, \r\n\r\nI know it may be sudden, but I want to invite
    you to live with me in Paris.\u2019\r"
  - "\u2018I can\u2019t wait for you to see it. It\u2019s unlike anything back home.
    A truly vital place, where anyone can be anything.\r'"
  - "After all, \u2018Baroness Yvette de Marbo\u2019 has a certain ring to it..."
  - "\u2018I can\u2019t wait for you to see it. It\u2019s unlike anything back home.
    A truly vital place, where anyone can be anything.\r'"
  - "Inside, a woman polishing a lantern looks up at you as you enter, and her face
    breaks into a bright smile. \"<i>Bonjour</i> Madame and welcome to the Orphan's
    Feast!\" Her eyes linger expectantly on the door for a moment, before settling
    on you. You're suddenly reminded of how rare it is for women to travel by themselves.\r"

    themselves.\r"
  - "\u201CHow may I be of service?\u201D She asks.\r"
  - "\u201CDon\u2019t worry, while the rest of the city can be rather\u2026 cutthroat,
    the Orphan\u2019s Feast is a relaxed place for getting your feet under you.\u201D
    The woman puts down the lantern she was polishing. "
  - "The barmaid pauses to think. \"I haven\u2019t heard that name before, but I just
    started working today. If you ask around, some of our patrons might know where
    to find your fiance.\""
  - "When she puts it that way, it suddenly sounds so easy\u2026"
  - Not that your parents cared much about the romance. At first you'd been afraid
    to tell them their youngest daughter wanted to move far away. Instead, they nearly
    threw you onto the carriage to follow Armand to Paris.
  - With a grunt of irritation, the coachman flicks at his reins and the carriage
    surges forward, sending you lurching back into your seat. The city blurs by as
    you wind your way towards The Orphan's Feast, a tavern where Armand said he would
    meet you.
  - "She favors you with a devious smile. \"\x1CFind guests worth talking to, and
    try to say the right things to the right people. You'll never have time to talk
    to everyone, so try to use your time wisely.\""
  - '"Ohhh a missing person. That actually sounds interesting." She says with a devious
    smile.'
  - "While you understood the significant benefits your common family would receive
    from your marriage into a noble one, you couldn't help but be a little annoyed
    at their eagerness to see you off.\r"
  - 'That was something you were looking forward to. A chance to be something more. '
  - "While you understood the significant benefits your common family would receive
    from your marriage into a noble one, you couldn't help but be a little annoyed
    at their eagerness to see you off.\r"
  - "Back in your provincial hometown, you were engaged to Armand, before he moved
    north to Paris to participate in the Estates General. He dreamed of changing the
    country, and this was the political event of the century. You mailed love letters
    soaked in perfume, he replied with volumes about how much he missed you. The romance
    of it all helped make up for the inconvenience.\r"

  - "As tired and rumpled as you are, you\x19're glad that he arranged to meet you
    in a place with ample food and wine.\r"
  - Your fiance, Armand, arranged for the carriage to take you from your small village
    to a tavern he enjoys called 'The Orphan's Feast'. There, he'll meet up with you,
    you'll likely take dinner together, and then he'll show you to your new home in
    Paris.
  - "Everything feels significant, like the world\x19's next act hinges on all of
    their choices. "
