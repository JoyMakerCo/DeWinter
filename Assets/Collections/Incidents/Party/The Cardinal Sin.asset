  - "\u201CFor a many of the cloth to commit the cardinal sin? It is the only explanation.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI hear that he loaded two bullets in his pistol before he\u2026 did it.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CWell that would certainly explain why it was a closed casket affair. There
    mustn\u2019t have been much of him left, after that.\u201D \n\nYour mind conjures
    up a gruesome image, entirely against your will, and you wretch internally at
    it.\r"
  - "However, this does give you the level of detail you were hoping for. A rumor,
    by itself isn\u2019t valuable. Details, on the other hand, make for fine gossip.
    This should be valuable to someone.\r"
  - "You hear a throat clear.\r\n\r\n\u201CCan we help you, madame?\u201D The younger
    man asks you, with a suspicious scowl.\r"
  - "Before you can answer, his older friend chimes in. \u201CPerhaps we should take
    our conversation elsewhere. I doubt that we\u2019ll find any privacy here.\u201D\r"
  - "The two of them disappear to a more secluded section of the party, watching you
    carefully all the while. \r\n\r\nYou have a feeling that you\u2019ll be watched
    more closely from now on.\r"
  - "The older guest stops his friend mid sentence. \u201CI\u2019m not sure if we
    should continue.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CI would not want to offend the madame\u2019s sensibilities with such dreadful
    details.\u201D\r"
  - "After a long pause, the older man relents. \u201CFine, if you must know...\u201D"
  - "\u201CDon\u2019t worry, such details are unnecessary to understanding the bigger
    picture.\u201D The older man says in an a patronizing tone.\r"
  - "\u201CThe archbishop of Grenoble shot himself.\u201D The younger man says flatly.
    \u201CIt was a suicide, and a particularly gruesome one at that. That\u2019s why
    he was in a closed casket instead of being laid out properly. It was also why
    the church was so unwilling to divulge the details of his death.\u201D"
  - "This is exactly the level of detail you were hoping for. A rumor, by itself,
    isn\u2019t of any consequence. Gruesome details, on the other hand, make for fine
    gossip. This should be valuable to someone.\r"
  - 'You continue your hushed conversation with the two men, and manage to tease out
    a few more specifics. The three of you eventually go your separate ways. '
  - "\u201CI suppose he\u2019s right.\u201D The younger man admits. \u201CWhat\u2019s
    most important is that archbishop\u2019s death was a suicide, and this made the
    church extremely uncomfortable. This is why they were so quiet about his passing.\u201D\r"
  - "During your conversation, you manage to get a few more details about the time
    of death, who discovered the body, and more. This is exactly what you were hoping
    for. A rumor, by itself, isn\u2019t of any consequence. Specific details add an
    air of truthfulness which is necessary for quality gossip. This should be valuable
    to someone.\r \r"
  - "\"\x1CI can understand why, madame. It was grizzly enough that the church didn'\x19t
    make any official announcements. The archbishop\x19s funeral was closed casket
    because-\x1D\r\""
  - "The younger man examines you carefully before he says \u201CThat\u2019s quite
    an unusual accent you have, for someone who grew up in Grenoble.\u201D\r\n\r\nYour
    mind races, and you\u2019re not sure if you can remember what a Grenoble accent
    even sounds like.\r"
  - "\u201CWell, if you did actually grow up there, you must be more familiar with
    the facts than us.\u201D The older man demures, already pulling his friend away
    by the elbow. \u201CWe would hate to supply you with any misinformation.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe
    puts a strong emphasis on the word \u2018supply\u2019.\r"
  - "The two of them disappear to a more secluded section of the party, watching you
    carefully all the while. \r\n\r\nYou have a feeling they didn\u2019t believe you.\r"
