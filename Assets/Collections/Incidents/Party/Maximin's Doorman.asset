    date. My apologies\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CIs there anything I can get you?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CAh yes, absolutely madame. The Baron shall hear of it quite soon.\u201D\r\n\r\r\nYou
    hear some murmurs from other guests in the Vestibule. Your gratitude and enthusiasm
    seem to have made an impression on them, though the doorman seems rather unphased.\r"
  - "With a small flourish, you present a bottle of wine you had the forethought to
    bring earlier. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but the gesture is more important.\r"
  - "He glances about the room expectantly. \u201CAnd\u2026 where may I find the good
    Baron?\u201D\r"
  - "The doorman\u2019s eyes widen in surprise, that was certainly not the sort of
    answer he was expecting. \u201COh my Madame, what an unfortunate turn of events.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou must be quite upset, is there anything I can get you?\u201D\r"
  - "Before you can ask any other questions, he bows deeply to you.\r\n\n\u201C<i>Pardonnez-moi
    , madame</i>. Baron de Termes instructed me specifically, to inform him as soon
    as you had arrived. We\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201D"
  - "\u201CEnjoy the party.\u201D He says with a smile, before leaving.\r"
  - "You hear some appreciative murmurs from other guests in the vestibule. Your gratitude
    and enthusiasm seem to have made an impression on them, eliminating some of the
    tension in the air.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the doorman himself seems rather unphased.\r"
  - "(You have gained a little credibility)\r"
  - "(You have spent 5 Livres)\r"
  - "(You have lost a little peril)\n(You have gained a little credibility)\r"
  - "\"Ah, <i>merci beaucoups</i> madame, I shall make sure the Baron is aware of
    your generosity.\" Turning from you, the doorman waves imperiously to another
    servant nearby, who takes the bottle from you. Afterwards, that servant dutifully
    scurries away.\r"
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Revolution Gossip. This will be useful later.)
  - "Immediately upon entering the vestibule, you\x19're greeted by a doorman holding
    a small ledger. While he isn\x19't physically barring your entry, his manner certainly
    is."
