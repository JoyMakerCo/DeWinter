  - "Looking for someone to talk to, you approach an older man who seems to be standing
    by himself and appraising the room. He nods politely to you as you approach.\r\n\r\n\u201CI
    don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen you here before.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CHow do you know our hostess, the Viscountess de Foix?\u201D"
  - "\x1C\"Oh, really?\x1D\" He leans back and appraises you anew. \"\x1CI'\x19ve
    never heard Marcelle mention you before.\x1D\""
  - "\u201CAh! The Viscountess inherited her title a few years ago, and her father\u2019s
    vast fortune with it. She\u2019s currently unwed, though a few suitors certainly
    appear to be trying to court her.\u201D The older man rapidly lists the hostesses\u2019
    qualities with the same tone that one might use to describe a horse they were
    trying to sell. "
  - "\u201CHowever, with her current level of favor at court, any suitor would have
    to be influential indeed in order to attract her notice. She also happens to be
    rather particular about her appearance, and in all my years of knowing her, I
    have yet to see her forget anyone who has slighted her.\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CDoes that help clarify things at all?\u201D He asks."
  - "\u201CExactly! Marcelle has many qualities, but humility and forgiveness are
    not among them.\u201D \r"
  - "The older man chuckles drolly at your blunt assessment. \u201CI would recommend
    that you do. Once the Viscountess de Foix has it in mind to hate someone, nothing
    will ever change her mind.\u201D"
  - With a polite nod, he exits the conversation to mingle in the rest of the party.
  - With a polite nod, he exits the conversation to mingle in the rest of the party.
  - "\u201CAh yes!\" He says, suddenly perking up. \"I remember her saying something
    about a summer home in the south of the country. For you to be here now, you must
    have quite the close bond with our hostess.\""
  - "\u201CPerhaps later on, you\u2019ll be able to put in a good word for me?\u201D\r"
  - You talk and laugh with him for a while longer, before you eventually part ways,
    in order to see what else is going on at the party.
  - "\u201CIn fact, I find your story\u2026 rather hard to believe.\u201D He replies,
    icily. \u201CI would go so far as to say that it\u2019s quite rude to lie about
    your relationship to the hostess. Marcelle would certainly not appreciate this,
    if she were to find out.\u201D\r"
  - You two stand together, swaddled in tense silence, before you decide to slink
    away.
  - "(You have lost some credibility)\r\n(You have gained a little peril)\r"
  - "(You have gained some credibility)\r"
  - "Over your shoulder, you hear an older woman\x19s voice call out. A brief glance
    reveals an elegant older woman, bedecked in jewelry, gesturing insistently with
    her fan.\r \"Ah, \x1C<i>pardon moi madame</i>, duty calls.\x1D\""

  - "\u201COh, Marcelle? Her family used to summer near mine in the south. We\u2019re
    old friends.\u201D"
  - "\u201CI\u2019ve actually never met her before. What\u2019s she like?\u201D"
  - 
  - 
  - "\u201CA monied woman of fashion who tolerates no fools? Interesting.\u201D"
  - "\u201CWealthy, vain, and somewhat vindictive? I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201D"
