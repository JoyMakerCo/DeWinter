  _nodeText:
  - You sweep your gaze over the crowded tavern, and strain your ears for the sound
    of Armand's voice, but have yet to find anything. It's hard to walk around with
    all of your luggage, which only slows your progress further.
  - 'The other patrons don''t look particularly happy with you either. You bump into
    yet countless patrons with your bags, and your searching is starting to give
    the impression that you''re eavesdropping.


    Just as you start to feel a
    little frustrated by this, the barmaid from before approaches you.'
  - '"Madame, you look parched, can I get you anything?"'
  - With a smile she seats you at a nearby table before heading to the basement to
    fetch your drink.
  - With a barely concealed frown, she seats you at a nearby table before excusing
    herself to fetch your drink.
  - 'She returns and presents you with the bottle, before pouring a dram into your
    glass. You sample the wine and signal your approval by placing a few livres on
    the table. The barmaid scoops up the coins with a grateful smile. '
  - "She returns with a metal pitcher and fills up a clay cup for you. You take a
    sip and note how even the water tastes different here. \n\nYou try to relax but
    to no avail. You can't help but notice that nobody else is drinking water, which
    only makes you feel more out of place."
  - '"Is there anything else I can get you, madame?"'
  - '"Now that you have your free water, do you want anything else?"'
  - '"Oh, a missing person? That sounds interesting! What''s he like?"'
  - '"Well, if he''s funny then he should be popular with the patrons. I''ll ask
    around for him, madame."'
  - '"A smart fellow like that shouldn''t be too hard to notice." '
  - '"Oh, I''ll definitely be on the lookout for him then!" The barmaid replies with
    a wink and a cheeky laugh. '
  - '"You just stay here, and I''ll see what I can find."'
  - "She leaves your table to inquire with the other patrons about Armand. You're
    not sure if your description was enough to go off of, but she knows the place
    better than you do. \n\nPerhaps she'll have better luck."
  - She returns a few minutes later and gives you a shrug. "Madame, I'm sorry to
    tell you this, but I simply can't find your Armand anywhere."
  - She slips a piece of paper to you. You glance down and see a hastily written
    note.
  - '"<i>Oui</i>, madame" She says with a curtsey.'
  - She leaves you to your drink, and you take this time to examine your fellow patrons.
    Now that you're not taking up too much space, people seem to have lost interest
    in you.
  - You spend the next hour sipping your wine and taking in the room, but can't seem
    to find any trace of Armand, even the sound of his laugh.
  - '"<i>Oui</i>, madame" She says with a curtsey.'
  - She leaves you to your drink, and you take this time to examine your fellow patrons.
    Now that you're not taking up too much space, people seem to have lost interest
    in you.
  - You spend the next hour sipping your water and taking in the room, but can't
    seem to find any trace of Armand, even the sound of his laugh.
  - "'Don't know what's going on. Patrons get upset when I mention your fianc\xE9.
    Even the owner won't talk."
  - The Barmaid gives you a tiny shrug, but otherwise remains silent.
  - The Barmaid startles at your sudden forwardness, and you can feel the weight
    of eyes in the tavern scrutinizing you both. "Madame, please understand that
    I can't help you." She replies, a little too loudly.
  - You stare at her expectantly, hoping that she'll grasp your intent.
  - Understanding your implication, the Barmaid sighs, and picks up the note. She
    scribbles for a while.
  - '"No madame, I believe your receipt has everything on it that we can put on it."
    She replies flatly.'
  - She leaves you, and you take this time to examine your fellow patrons. Now that
    you're not taking up too much space, people seem to have lost interest in you.
  - You spend the next hour taking in the room, but can't seem to find any trace
    of Armand, even the sound of his laugh.
  - "When you get it back, it reads.\n\n'I think your fianc\xE9 has made a powerful
    enemy. Don't know who. Don't know why. You'll have to get the rest from him.'"
  - By the time you look up from her note, she's already gone.
  - She gives you a quick curtsey and shuffles away, taking care to avoid any eye
    contact with you as she leaves.
  - Now that you're seated and sipping some of the house wine, you can see that the
    other patrons relax more around you. You're just another person stopping in for
    some rest and a quick drink.
  - The Barmaid sighs, and picks up the note. She scribbles on it for a while.
  - (You have spent 5 Livres)
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - (You have gained a little peril)
  - (You have gained some peril)
  - 'Surveying the room again, you can see that some of the curiosity about you has
    abated. You''re just another traveller, looking for rest and refreshement.


    (You
    have gained a little Credibility)'
  - With a shaky sigh, she picks up the note she gave you before, and starts scribbling.
