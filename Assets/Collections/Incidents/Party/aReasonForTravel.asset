  - You approach a man standing by himself. His wig is slightly disheveled, and he
    has fresh mud on his boots.
  - "\u201CAh, <i>bonjour</i> madame! You must have just arrived in Paris as well.\u201D
    He says affably."
  - "\u201CWhere did you journey from?\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CDo not worry madame, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to return there
    soon enough!\u201D He replies with a warm laugh. \u201CI myself came a few months
    ago from similar, idyllic surroundings in Brittany.\u201D \r"
  - "\u201CWell, madame you are in luck, for you have arrived in the most significant
    city in all the world.\u201D"
  - '"The Baron de Marbo?" He pauses to think, scratching his chin. "Why does that
    name sound so familiar?"'
  - "\u201CBut of course, the harvest has not been so good this year, which is what
    brings me to Paris. I\u2019m searching for a way to revitalize our estate. Back
    home, I tried new farming techniques, imported tools, and I even built a shrine
    to Saint Isidore himself! Yet, it was to no avail. So I am here, in search of
    a solution.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201C<i>Et vous, madame</i>? What has brought you to Paris, so far from home?\u201D"
  - "\"You've travelled all the way here for your fianc\xE9? Such love and devotion
    reminds me of when I was your age.\" His eyes have a far off look for a moment.
    \"Never let yourself lose sight of such things.\""
  - '"Ambition, advancement, and glory? Such things are not easy for a commoner like
    yourself. However, you are correct, Paris is the place best for those looking
    to raise their station."'
  - "\"Seeking the finer things in life? Well, you\u2019re in the right place for
    it. Fashion is a way of life here.\"  He gestures around the tavern, and you
    can see that even the people of more humble means have chosen their attire carefully."
  - "\u201CAnd what has brought you to this bustling metropolis?\u201D"
  - '"I think you''ll fit in well with the merchants, lawyers, and physicians of
    the Bourgeoisie." '
  - '"Sorry, madame. I simply... haven''t been here long enough to know enough about
    him." '
  - '"Are you here in the city alone?"'
  - '"Allow me to suggest that you take some time to speak with members of the army,
    and their supporters. They come from backgrounds both high and low, yet they''re
    all willing to sacrifice so much to raise their station just a little." '
  - '"If that is why you are here, you might want to seek out those associated with
    the church. Love and tradition are very much on their minds."


'
  - '"I''m sorry madame, I must go. I have an urgent appointment." He says very brusquely. '
  - '"Thank you for your understanding madame." He says with a polite nod before
    he drains his wineglass. "Now it appears that, I must go. I have an urgent appointment."'
  - Without another word, he drains his wineglass and begins to leave.
  - He departs, leaving you with your thoughts, and more questions.
  - '"So, this Armand of yours, what brought him to Paris?"'
  - He nods his head affably. "My apologies madame, I didn't mean to pry. Discretion
    is such a rare virtue in this day and age, that I'd almost forgotten it entirely."
  - 'The two of you spend the next few minutes exchanging small talk and pleasant
    travel stories. It''s nice to talk with another person again, even if it''s about
    nothing in particular. '
  - Eventually he excuses himself, as he needs to make it to some sort of appointment.
  - "The traveler startles at your sudden forwardness, and you can feel the weight
    of eyes in the tavern watching the next moments. \"Madame, please understand
    that I cannot say much more. Your fianc\xE9 has made a powerful enemy, and if
    you don't know how he did that, then you might want to reconsider him entirely.\""
  - While you may have learned something, you feel like you still have more questions
    than answers. You should be able to clear all of this up when you find Armand.
  - His eyes go wide for a moment before settling into an expression of discomfort.
    Gathering up his things, he starts preparing to leave.
  - Without another word, he pulls free of your grasp, drains his wineglass and leaves.
  - He sighs and looks from side to side, obviously torn on what to do.
  - "Getting close to you, he whispers. \"If you must know madame, your fianc\xE9
    has made a powerful enemy, and if you don't know how he did that, then you might
    want to reconsider him entirely.\""
  - Without another word, he drains his wineglass and leaves.
  - (You've gained a little favor with members of the Church. Don't worry, you'll
    meet them later!)
  - (You've gained a little favor with members of the Military. Don't worry, you'll
    meet them later!)
  - (You've gained a little favor with members of the Bourgeoisie. Don't worry, you'll
    meet them later!)
  - (You've gained a little credibility)
  - (You've gained a little peril)
  - (You've lost some credibility)
  - (You've gained a little credibility)
  - A pleasant diversion, but you're no closer to finding Armand than when you started.
