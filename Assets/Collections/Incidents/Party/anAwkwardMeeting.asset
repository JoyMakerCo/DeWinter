  - "Checking your mental map of the venue, you\u2019re absolutely certain that this
    room will be the best place to hang up the painting, and expose Maximin\u2019s
    crimes. For a moment, you lose yourself in thought while you survey the room
    for the perfect spot to hang your masterpiece of vengeance. The room is even
    mostly empty.\r"
  - "It\u2019s then that you hear someone clear their throat behind you. "
  - "\u201CWhat. Are. You. Doing. Here?\u201D Maximin growls at you.\r"
  - "He squints at you suspiciously, then does the same to Camille, who does her
    best to haughtily avoid any eye contact.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Queen\u2019s personal
    painter wants to present a painting at my salon? That is rather unexpected.\u201D\r"
  - He sneers at your insult, and clutches his wineglass hard enough that his knuckles
    start to turn white.
  - "\u201CI\u2019m glad that she understands the superiority of my tastes.\u201D
    He says with a broad smile before advancing on Camille and reaching for the sheet
    covering the painting. \u201CI will, of course, have to inspect the artwork to
    make sure that it meets my refined standards.\u201D\r"
  - "Before you can think of an acceptable excuse, someone else decides to join your
    conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Baron Maximin! It\u2019s so great to see you.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201COh yes, how may I help you, madame?\u201D He turns to answer the woman
    behind him, having to prioritize etiquette over his own curiosity. "
  - "Spying an opportunity, you join the conversation, in order to give Camille some
    time to set up the painting.\r"
  - (You have gained a little peril)
  - (You have gained a little credibility)
  - "\u201CI should have expected such a base attack from someone as ignorant and
    unrefined as yourself. I'm told that you've recently decided to latch onto Madame
    Le Brun. Perhaps you hoped the Queen\u2019s personal painter would take you a
    little further than your Armand, yes?\u201D"
  - "Before you can think of a suitably stinging rejoinder, someone else decides
    to join your conversation.\r\n\r\n\u201COh, Baron Maximin! It\u2019s so great
    to see you.\u201D\r"

  - "\u201CJust delivering a painting on behalf of Madame Le Brun. You\u2019ll love
    it.\u201D"

    spoiled the effect.\""
