  - 'When your carriage drops you off at the party, you find yourself waiting in
    line for quite some time. Looking at the other guests, you wonder if you''re
    underdressed... or overdressed, it''s honestly hard to tell. '
  - "\u201CName, Madame?\u201D he asks expectantly."
  - "The doorman looks perplexed at you for a moment, flipping through his ledger.\r
    \u201CI do not see your name here, madame\u2026\u201D\r"
  - "The valet looks shocked. \u201CBaron? Why are you dressed-\u201D"
  - "\u201CAh, that is most unfortunate.\u201D the doorman replies, surprisingly
    disappointed. \u201CThe good Viscountess de Foix was so looking forward to seeing
    him tonight. Please convey our deepest regrets at his absence, our well-wishes
    to his health.\u201D"
  - "He frowns at your irritation, but only for a moment. The doorman flips back
    and forth between the pages of his ledger before his finds what he\u2019s looking
    for. \u201CAh yes! You are the date to Baron Armand de Marbo. If I so remember,
    you are his fianc\xE9e, <i>non</i>?\u201D\r"
  - "A moment later he composes himself. \r\u201CAh, I see, you are the Baron\u2019s
    date. My apologies.\u201D"
  - "\u201CIs there anything I can get you?\u201D"
  - "\u201C<i>Oui oui</i> madame. I shall make sure that the Viscountess hears of
    it myself.\u201D\r\n\r\nYou hear some murmurs from other guests in the Vestibule.
    Your gratitude and enthusiasm seem to have made an impression on them, though
    the doorman seems rather unphased.\r"
  - "He glances about the room expectantly. \u201CAnd\u2026 where may I find the
    good Baron?\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CAh, that is most unfortunate.\u201D the doorman replies, surprisingly
    disappointed. \u201CThe good Viscountess de Foix was so looking forward to seeing
    him tonight. Please convey our deepest regrets at his absence, our our well-wishes
    to his health.\u201D\r"
  - "The doorman\u2019s eyes widen in surprise, that was certainly not the sort of
    answer he was expecting. \u201COh my Madame, what an unfortunate turn of events.\u201D\r"
  - "\u201CYou must be quite upset, is there anything I can get you?\u201D"
  - "With a small flourish, you present a bottle of wine you had the forethought
    to bring earlier. It wasn\u2019t cheap, but the gesture is more important.\r"
  - "Before you can ask any other questions, he bows deeply you to you.\r\n\n\u201C<i>Pardonnez-moi,
    Madame</i>. Viscountess de Foix instructed me specifically, to inform her as
    soon as you had arrived. We\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201D"
  - "\u201CEnjoy the party.\u201D He says with a smile, before leaving."
  - "You hear some appreciative murmurs from other guests in the Vestibule. Your
    gratitude and enthusiasm seem to have made an impression on them, doing away
    with some of the tension in the air.\r Surprisingly, the doorman himself seems
    rather unphased.\r"
  - "(You have spent 10 Livres)\r"
  - '(You have lost a tiny amount of peril)

    (You have gained a tiny amount of
    credibility)'
  - "(You have gained a little credibility)\r"
  - "\"\x1CAh, <i>merci beaucoups madame</i>, I shall make sure the Viscountess is
    aware of your generosity.\x1D\" Turning from you, he waves imperiously to another
    servant nearby, who takes the bottle from you. Afterwards, the servant dutifully
    scurries away.\r"
  - While you're determining your standing in the world of fashion, you manage to
    overhear an interesting rumor while in line. You make a mental note of it, just
    in case.
  - (You have gained a piece of Cheap Crown Gossip. This will be useful later.)
  - "Immediately upon entering the vestibule, you\x19're greeted by a doorman holding
    a small ledger. While he isn\x19't physically barring your entry, his manner
    certainly is.\r"
  - You look over yourself one last time and confirm that you're wearing your $OUTFITNAME
    to a party being held by the $PARTYFACTIONNAME.
  - (The guests have no strong feelings on your outfit, and your credibility has
    not changed much)
  - With preparations like this, the results of tonight could be a toss-up.
  - (The guests greatly approve of your outfit, and your credibility has increased
    significantly)
  - (The guests approve of your outfit, and your credibility has increased)
  - With preparations like this, tonight should be a largely positive affair.
  - With preparations like this, tonight is yours for the taking.
  - (The guests disapprove of your outfit, and your credibility has decreased)
  - With preparations like this, tonight could go poorly if you aren't careful.
  - (The guests greatly disapprove of your outfit, and your credibility has decreased
    significantly)
  - With preparations like this, tonight could go very poorly indeed.
  - You're thankfully well rested for this particular event, so you manage to feel
    invigorated, and ready to take on whatever comes your way.
  - (Being well rested has given you a credibility bonus!)
  - Unfortunately, you can feel exhaustion set in as soon as you think of the full
    itinerary ahead of you. Tonight is going to be a long night.
  - You're neither well rested, nor exhausted. Nothing is holding you back from doing
    your best in this game of wits.
  - (Being exhausted has given you a credibility penalty)
