  _nodeText:
  - You enter Pierre's office to find it more dissheveled than usual. The printing
    press is coated with stray blotches of ink, and scraps of test paper litter the
    floor. It looks like he's been busy, indeed. Somewhere, deeper in the office,
    you can hear someone muttering a steady stream of staggeringly foul profanity.
  - Pierre walks into the room wearing a sour look on it his face, and carrying a
    stack of recently finished newspapers. He doesn't even put them down to greet
    you. "I'm disappointed in you, $PLAYER."
  - '"We had an agreement and you didn''t deliver the gossip you promised on time.
    You''re not just an informant, you''re a reporter now! I expected better from
    you."'
  - '"Now then..." He grumbles. "To business?"'
  - (You have lost some credibility)
  - He puts down the stack of newspapers, and pauses to noisily inhale a pinch of
    snuff.
