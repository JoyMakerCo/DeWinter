  - 'Deciding to explore the 5th <i>arrondisement</i> today, you stroll along the
    southern banks of the river Seine. Barges sail up and down the river, jockeying
    for position with the pleasure crafts of the wealthy, and the ocassional floating
    bathhouse.


    A merry patron of one such bathhouse waves to you from the comfort of his tub.'
  - Just as you cross the street, you spot a verdant clearing ahead of you.
  - 'Looking around at the well manicured greenery, you realize that you''ve arrvied
    at the <i>Jardin Des Plantes</i>. It''s beautiful and tranquil. A lush respite
    from the bustle and cacophany of the city.


    Couples stroll the paths, arm in arm. Furtive glances and nods of respect are
    exchanged between passing groups, as people put forth their best efforts to see
    and be seen.'
  - "Pulling out your journal, you jot down the location. \n\n(<i>Jardin Des Plantes</i>
    is now an available rendezvous location)"
  - After lingering a few minutes further, you head home. Hopefully, you'll be able
    visit the gardens again soon.
  - You head home immediately, taking a detour through some of the more lively parts
    of time in order to get your energy back up again. Hopefully, you won't have occassion
    to visit the gardens too often.
  - This is the perfect place to go with someone who wanted to get some fresh air,
    without the oppressing crowds of the city.
